    "text": "In the early years of the 20th century, homeownership was a cherished dream for many families. Yet without the long-term, fixed rate mortgage most homeowners have today, saving for a down payment was tough, loans were short-term, and large balloon payments awaited when those notes came due.\nDuring the Great Depression, nearly a quarter of the nation’s homeowners lost their homes to foreclosure. Banks simply didn’t have the funds to make mortgage loans. To address the situation, the United States government created Fannie Mae and charged it with the mission it continues to serve today: to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability in the mortgage market.\nFannie Mae helped banks finance a new type of mortgage: the long-term, fixed-rate home loan. The innovative mortgage loan expanded access to affordable homeownership, offered homeowners more certainty about their monthly mortgage payments, and transformed the housing industry.\nAt Fannie Mae, we continue our mission to help make stable, efficient, and affordable mortgage loans available in the United States. We strive to be America’s most valued housing partner by maintaining responsible risk management for sustainable housing finance and leading with innovative mortgage solutions.\nDuring the Great Depression, there was a recognized need for a reliable, steady source of funding for housing. At the time, affordable mortgage credit was inaccessible for many families.\nFannie Mae financed home purchases for millions of American soldiers returning from World War II. The nation’s economy grew rapidly and the liquidity Fannie Mae provided allowed mortgage lenders to have the cash on hand to meet the demand.\nHomeownership grew throughout the country during the second half of the 20th century and fueled the rise of the middle class. The Charter Act reorganized Fannie Mae from a government agency into a mixed ownership corporation in 1954.\nIn the 1968 Housing and Urban Development Act, Fannie Mae became a private shareholder-owned corporation chartered by the U.S. Congress. After being removed from the federal budget, Fannie Mae funded its operations through stock and bond markets.\nIn the 1980s, the development of mortgage-backed securities brought capital from global markets to the U.S. housing industry. Fannie Mae securitized mortgage loans and guaranteed payment to investors, which it continues to do today.\nHousing prices plummeted and delinquencies rose during the financial crisis, and the government-sponsored enterprises lost billions of dollars on investment portfolios and mortgage-backed security guarantees. The federal government put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nThe company returned to profitability in 2012.  In 2014, Fannie Mae had paid back all funds it received when it first went under conservatorship and has since put billions into the U.S. Treasury."

Instead, we purchase mortgage loans made by lenders, who are then able to use those funds to offer mortgage loans to more people. We partner with mortgage lenders and servicers, housing counselors, real estate agents, nonprofit organizations, and other industry professionals to help people obtain a home and stay in that home when faced with hardship or disaster.\nFannie Mae's work — expanding access and opportunity — is focused on two primary types of housing.\nOur Single-Family business helps homebuyers purchase and refinance homes. We support mortgage lenders by acquiring the mortgage loans they originate. We package loans we acquire into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that we guarantee, attracting investors to the U.S. secondary mortgage market. Our financing solutions enable lenders to offer 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which provide homeowners stable, predictable mortgage payments over the life of their loans.\nWe develop and maintain underwriting and eligibility standards for Fannie Mae loans.

    "text": "While our role providing liquidity and stability to the residential mortgage market and promoting affordable access to mortgage credit has remained constant, we’ve strengthened our business model significantly since entering conservatorship. This makes us better able to withstand market fluctuations and respond to risk. And we’re better prepared to serve homebuyers and renters in good times and tough times.\nPreviously, we earned most of our revenue by holding a large investment portfolio of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Today, we have drastically reduced our portfolio and shifted to a more stable, guaranty fee-driven business model. Our model is focused on receiving a steady stream of monthly fees to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on the mortgage-backed securities we sell to American and global investors.\nAs we’ve transitioned our business model, we’ve achieved 13 straight years of annual profitability. We’ve now paid approximately $181 billion to the Treasury in senior preferred stock dividends, which is about $62 billion more than we have received in support from the government since 2008. And in just the past 5 years, when we’ve been permitted to retain our earnings, we’ve increased our net worth by over $81 billion, resulting in nearly $95 billion of net worth as of the end of 2024.\nWe provide financing every day to help strengthen the housing market, which contributes to the economy, job growth, and a better quality of life across America. Our role is even more critical in tough moments for the economy. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many other financial institutions held back their mortgage purchases, which would have prevented many people from securing a mortgage or refinancing. Fannie Mae stepped in and provided additional support, increasing our mortgage purchases to ensure a strong housing market and help the economy.\nAt the same time, we developed innovative and flexible tools for mortgage companies to help renters and homeowners impacted by the pandemic. For homeowners facing financial hardships, we offered the option to suspend or delay mortgage payments up to 18 months. We helped more than 1.4 million homeowners under this plan.\nFannie Mae stepped in during the pandemic to support access to homeownership\nTo help ensure we are able to meet the housing market’s needs in times of stress, the U.S. government has established rigorous bank-like capital requirements that we will be required to meet to allow us to operate during difficult economic periods. We are building our capital reserves to meet these requirements.\nAt the same time, since entering conservatorship, we’ve focused on improving the resilience and credit quality of the book of mortgages we guarantee. This greater resilience is shown in the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (known as DFAST) our regulator mandates that we conduct to assess our ability to withstand difficult economic conditions. Over the past few years, our DFAST results have shown limited or no pre-tax losses during severe economic downturn scenarios that were far worse than the 2008 financial crisis. This underscores the strength of our business and its ability to serve as a source of stability in the market today and in the future.\n12017 GAAP net income includes a $9.9B provision for federal income taxes resulting from the remeasurement of Fannie Mae’s deferred tax assets due to the corporate tax reduction in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n2Dividend payments do not reduce the senior preferred stock’s liquidation preference, which includes cumulative amounts drawn from Treasury.\n3For information on how these ratios are calculated and what they represent, see endnote 17 of ourQ4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Supplement.\n4U.S. G-SIB banks refers to United States global systemically important banks, as defined by the Financial Stability Board.

We play an essential role in the U.S. economy, especially during tough economic times, by helping to ensure a stable source of funding to offer home mortgages, in all markets and in all business cycles. This report is largely dedicated to describing the residential needs of low- and moderate-income families. In 2024, low- and moderate-income families faced challenges in the housing market, including a high-interest rate environment, elevated housing prices, and an ongoing shortage of affordable homes for purchase or rent. Despite these challenges, Fannie Mae has been able to provide a reliable source of liquidity to the housing market, help improve housing affordability, and support homeowner and renter stability at every stage of the housing journey.\nRead the AHARRead the AMR\nAs required by Fannie Mae’s Charter Act and implementing regulations, the company submits its Annual Housing Activities Report (“AHAR”) and Annual Mortgage Report (“AMR”).\nThe AHAR and AMR reflect housing activities undertaken by Fannie Mae and the company’s performance against our housing goals established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”).\nThe AHAR and AMR include data tables that provide information about each goal and our performance under each goal and subgoal.

The HPSI reflects consumers’ current views and forward-looking expectations of housing market conditions and complements existing data sources to inform housing-related analysis and decision-making. The HPSI is constructed from answers to six NHS questions that solicit consumers’ evaluations of housing market conditions and address topics that are related to their home purchase decisions. The questions ask consumers whether they think that it is a good or bad time to buy or to sell a house, what direction they expect home prices and mortgage interest rates to move, how concerned they are about losing their jobs, and whether their incomes are higher or lower than they were a year earlier.\nOn the right rail of this webpage, you will find the latest Data Release highlighting the consumer attitudinal indicators, month-over-month key indicator data, an overview and white paper about the HPSI, technical notes providing in-depth information about the National Housing Survey methodology, the questionnaire used for the survey, and a comparative assessment of Fannie Mae’s National Housing Survey and other consumer surveys.\nNational Housing Survey Monthly Indicators ArchiveClickherefor an archived list of Fannie Mae's National Housing Survey Monthly Indicators.\nOpinions, analyses, estimates, forecasts, beliefs, and other views of Fannie Mae's Economic and Strategic Research (ESR) Group or survey respondents included in these materials should not be construed as indicating Fannie Mae's business prospects or expected results, are based on a number of assumptions, and are subject to change without notice.

Using insurance claims to proxy for damages we find that both short-term delinquency and forbearance take-up are positively associated with damages. Loan modification is positively correlated with damages of up to 50 percent of property value and negatively correlated thereafter, suggesting that, for severely damaged homes with flood insurance, loan modifications are not an attractive remedy for delinquency concerns.Read more»\nMultifamily Investors Expected to Stay Focused on South Florida Despite Climate Challenges\nMay 7, 2024\nDespite climate-related challenges, as well as other external factors, including elevated interest rates, higher construction costs, and sky-rocketing property insurance premiums, both residents and real estate investors have a positive longer-term outlook on the southeastern region of the Sunshine State, especially for the multifamily sector.Read more»\nThe Impact of 2019 Changes to Texas' Flood Disclosure Requirements on House Prices\nFebruary 21, 2024\nThis paper examines the impact of a 2019 change to Texas' real estate disclosure law that introduced requirements to disclose when a property is in a moderate risk flood zone and increased the prominence of all flood-related disclosures.Read more»\nThe Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program: A Comprehensive Review\nJanuary 23, 2024\nThis review explores literature assessing the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program.

Making a good loan choice is not easy. The typical borrower faces a dozen or more individual cash charges and an interest rate that will determine the amount of the loan payments. The mortgage market is a negotiated market, prices are not fixed. The borrower’s inexperience versus the skill and experience of lenders, realtors, and title and settlement agents gives a negotiating advantage to better-informed side. Some borrowers end up with good deals, and some with not-so-good. This paper studies how the cost of a mortgage varies with loan and borrower characteristics, such as loan amount, borrower race, credit score, borrower income and education, geography, type of lender, whether the borrower was a first-time homebuyer, and more.Read more»\nNext to Kin: How Children Influence the Housing and Mobility Decisions of Older Adults\nJune 1, 2022\nThis Fannie Mae working paper explores the residential mobility of older adults, with a focus on the influence of distance to children on those decisions.Read more»\nMortgage costs as a share of housing costs—placing the cost of credit in broader context\nMarch 9, 2022\nFannie Mae’s latest working paper focuses on the different components of housing costs to show the contribution of each expense to overall housing costs, specifically focusing on a breakdown of mortgage costs.Read more»\nAppraising the Appraisal\nJanuary 20, 2022\nFannie Mae's latest research evaluates appraisal values of homes owned by Black and white borrowers refinancing their homes.Read more»\nBarriers to Entry: Closing Costs for First-Time and Low-Income Homebuyers\nDecember 2, 2021\nFannie Mae's latest research on affordable housing solutions shows that closing costs are a meaningful obstacle to sustainable homeownership for first-time and low-income first-time homebuyers, including Black and Hispanic borrowers.Read more»\nSolar at High Noon: Solar Home Premiums in a Rapidly Maturing Market\nJuly 2, 2021\nIn this Fannie Mae working paper, we explore how current premiums have changed over time, particularly in relation to changes in solar replacement costs and energy savings.Read more»\nSeeking Alpha in the Housing Market\nJune 15, 2021\nThis Fannie Mae working paper examined short term trades in the housing market over the period 2000–2013 using nationally representative data across multiple U.S. housing markets.Read more»\nAdverse Selection and Climate Risk\nMarch 30, 2021\nThis Fannie Mae working paper investigated the 2019 findings of Ouazad and Kahn and found no evidence that mortgage lenders change their loan origination, approval, and securitization practices in areas affected by major hurricanes.Read more»\nDensity Control, Home Price Appreciation, and Rental Growth in the United States\nDecember 23, 2020\nThis Fannie Mae working paper investigates density control in the top 50 U.S. metropolitan areas using National Longitudinal Land Use Survey (NLLUS) data from 1994, 2003, and 2019.Read more»\nWhen Appraisers Go Low, Contracts Go Lower: The Impact of Expert Opinions on Transaction Prices\nOctober 8, 2020\nUsing home purchase loan application data, this Fannie Mae working papers studies buyer responses to the uncommon occurrence of the appraised value coming in below the contract price (i.e. a low appraisal), which sharply raises the probability of downward price renegotiation.Read more»\nImpediments to Post-Great Recession Recovery of Homeowner Mobility\nSeptember 1, 2020\nThis paper introduces a novel data set of Fannie Mae proprietary loan and market transaction observations to document the current experience and historical context of homeowner mobility.

Although mortgage demand has since cooled due to higher interest rates, the rise in remote work has increased households' willingness to commute farther or even relocate to a different region.Read more»\nFannie Mae Updates Demographic Projections\nAugust 2, 2024\nWe provide an overview of the methodology and our outlook regarding projected growth in total households, owner households, and renter households over the 2023-2032 time period.

To gain a more holistic sense of their financial situations, we also asked consumers questions about their non-housing finances, including debt levels and their perceived financial resilience.Read more»\nFannie Mae Now Collects First-of-Its-Kind LGBT Data Through National Housing Survey\nJune 20, 2024\nWith the introduction of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) identifiers in the National Housing Survey® (NHS), Fannie Mae can now survey consumers who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) regarding their attitudes, intentions, and financial circumstances that pertain to housing and mortgage markets. In this first report, we analyzed data collected in 2023.Read more»\nFinancial Benefits Motivated Homebuying During the Pandemic, More So Than Space or Location Preferences\nJanuary 11, 2023\nSingle-family housing was an unintended beneficiary of the pandemic and its associated policy response. During the pandemic, mortgage rates reached historically low levels, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate hovering around 3% though the end of 2021. Despite a low inventory-to-sales ratio during this time period by historical standards, as well as rising home prices, both home sales and purchase mortgage originations reached record highs in 2021. Anecdotal and analytical evidence suggest that the pandemic prompted people to move from smaller housing units in high-density city centers to larger homes in lower-density areas; and this was particularly true of first-time homebuyers. Our researchers studied this phenomenon, and our survey findings illustrate the primacy of financial considerations over the benefits of physical space and location in influencing homebuying behavior during the pandemic.Read more»\nThe U.S. Housing Shortage from a Local Perspective\nOctober 28, 2022\nIn this report, Fannie Mae economists examine the contours of housing supply for 75 major U.S. metropolitan markets in a way that might offer clues to addressing the housing supply crisis at the local level.Read more»\nHousing Poised to Become Strong Driver of Inflation\nJune 9, 2021\nDespite rapid house price appreciation, due to the way shelter costs are measured, housing has actually helped hold back the recent surge in in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from moving even higher. However, that is soon likely to change as strong house price gains flow into common price measures, likely contributing to an elevated rate of overall inflation through at least 2022.Read more»\nCOVID-19 Led First-Time Homebuyers to Move Away from Highly Dense City Centers\nMarch 30, 2021\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the country in 2020, it touched nearly every aspect of the U.S. economy.

The analyses and other views in these materials represent the views of the author(s) as of the date indicated and do not necessarily represent the views of Fannie Mae's Economic & Strategic Research Group, Fannie Mae or its management.\nDo New Housing Units Next Door Raise Your Rents?\nSeptember 1, 2020\nHousehold income has not kept pace with housing demand in recent years and housing costs as a share of income is a key concern for many households. The potential of increasing housing supply to help ease housing cost burdens is not well understood empirically, and it is debated whether creation of new housing units would help, or hurt, nearby residents. While new development could provide needed relief to unmet housing demand in the local market, and thus reduce local housing costs, it could attract high-income residents and new amenities to a neighborhood, driving up prices and leading to gentrification and displacement. Studies looking to untangle these competing effects often struggle to find adequate data on rents over time at the local level. In recent research sponsored by Fannie Mae’s Economic & Strategic Research Group, NYU Furman Center Doctoral Fellow Xiaodi Li uses unique data on housing construction, rents, and prices in New York City, coupled with a thoughtful research design, to tackle these challenges.Read more»\nMortgage Journeys: A Video Ethnography of the Homebuying and Mortgage Process\nApril 25, 2019\nIn March, Abt Associates Inc., a public policy research firm, published a research paper that presented findings about the mortgage shopping experiences of lower-income, first-time homebuyers. Fannie Mae commissioned the video ethnography study, and Mark Palim, Vice President and Deputy Chief Economist, authored aPerspectives blogbased on its findings. Overall, the research illuminated the need to improve the ease of mortgage shopping for this cohort of homebuyers at all stages of the homebuying process.Read more»|Read the Perspectives blog»\nLow Income Homeownership and the Role of State Affordable Mortgage Programs\nMay 17, 2018\nEnabling access to affordable and sustainable homeownership has long been a goal of U.S. housing policy and is central to Fannie Mae's mission. A critical part of achieving this mission is to support programs and lenders that extend homeownership sustainably – that is, providing mortgages to lower income households who are able to maintain their mortgage payments over time. Affordable lending programs administered through state Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) provide a potential vehicle for realizing this goal, but there are few empirical analyses of HFA originated mortgages. In their recent working paper, professors from The Ohio State University, San Jose State University, and the University of Chicago use data on first-time homebuyer mortgages securitized by Fannie Mae between 2005 and 2014 to estimate the impact of HFA originations on loan performance.Read more»\nCohort Transitions and Age Group Analysis of Millennial Homeownership Demand: Understanding Trajectories of Recovery Following the Great Recession\nMay 9, 2018\nHow we perceive Millennial homeownership trends is influenced directly by the choice of method for measuring change. Whereas the traditional \"age-group\" approach suggests that Millennial homeownership demand remains in a recession-induced stupor, the more dynamic \"cohort\" perspective indicates that young-adult demand has begun to rebound along with the economy. But how do these two radically different views on Millennial homeownership comport with data on young-adult home buying activity? New research from the University of Southern California and Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, in partnership with Fannie Mae, shows that the age-group approach produces a lagging view of Millennial homeownership demand that does not correspond with current market data on home purchases, whereas the cohort approach offers a consistent contemporaneous perspective.Read more»\nSimulation of Young-Adult Homeownership Change through 2035: Effects of Growing Diversity and Rising Educational Attainment\nJune 20, 2017\nIn the latest and final installment of a working paper series on young-adult homeownership, University of Southern California researchers simulate how future changes in the characteristics of young adults might affect changes in their homeownership rate. The analysis estimates prospective changes between 2015 and 2035 in the prevalence of homeownership among young adults aged 25 to 44, prime ages for first-time homebuying. The simulations place special emphasis on how increases in racial and ethnic diversity and alternative scenarios for future college educational attainment might alter the trajectory of young-adult homeownership.Read more»\nThe Shifting Determinants of Young-Adult Homeownership Before and After the Great Recession\nMarch 30, 2017\nIn the most recent report from their ongoing study of young-adult homeownership, University of Southern California researchers explore the effects of young adults' race, education, income, and wealth on their homeownership attainment in the pre- and post-recession periods, independent of the socioeconomic status of their parents.Read more»\nSeniors' Access to Home Equity: Identifying Existing Mechanisms and Impediments to Broader Adoption\nFebruary 28, 2017\nWhy are older homeowners so reluctant to draw on housing wealth to help secure a more comfortable retirement? In the second of a series of studies on seniors and home equity sponsored by Fannie Mae and conducted by the Urban Institute, Karan Kaul and Laurie Goodman begin to explore this conundrum. The new working paper describes the various mechanisms that seniors could use to access home equity, identifies impediments keeping them from extracting equity, and offers recommendations for overcoming these obstacles.Read more»\nStarting to Understand the Potential Role of Home Equity in Enhancing Retirement Security\nNovember 1, 2016\nIn the first of a series of studies sponsored by Fannie Mae, the Urban Institute examines the potential role of home equity in improving retirement security.Read more»\nEducation and the Intergenerational Transmission of Homeownership\nSeptember 14, 2016In a new study sponsored by Fannie Mae, researchers from the University of Southern California unpack the complex linkages between educational attainment and homeownership attainment. As parents play a role both in supporting their children’s education and in helping them buy homes, the authors examine the importance of parental background compared with individual resources (including education) in the achievement of homeownership. Overall, the findings suggest that parental background has a strong effect on children’s chances for both higher education and homeownership, but education maintains an independent effect on homeownership attainment that could help reduce disparities in access.Learn More»\nParental Financial Assistance and Young-Adult Homeownership\nApril 26, 2016In this study, researchers from the University of Southern California examine the prevalence of parental financial assistance and its effect on young-adult transitions into homeownership.

    "text": "In the early years of the 20th century, homeownership was a cherished dream for many families. Yet without the long-term, fixed rate mortgage most homeowners have today, saving for a down payment was tough, loans were short-term, and large balloon payments awaited when those notes came due.\nDuring the Great Depression, nearly a quarter of the nation’s homeowners lost their homes to foreclosure. Banks simply didn’t have the funds to make mortgage loans. To address the situation, the United States government created Fannie Mae and charged it with the mission it continues to serve today: to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability in the mortgage market.\nFannie Mae helped banks finance a new type of mortgage: the long-term, fixed-rate home loan. The innovative mortgage loan expanded access to affordable homeownership, offered homeowners more certainty about their monthly mortgage payments, and transformed the housing industry.\nAt Fannie Mae, we continue our mission to help make stable, efficient, and affordable mortgage loans available in the United States. We strive to be America’s most valued housing partner by maintaining responsible risk management for sustainable housing finance and leading with innovative mortgage solutions.\nDuring the Great Depression, there was a recognized need for a reliable, steady source of funding for housing. At the time, affordable mortgage credit was inaccessible for many families.\nFannie Mae financed home purchases for millions of American soldiers returning from World War II. The nation’s economy grew rapidly and the liquidity Fannie Mae provided allowed mortgage lenders to have the cash on hand to meet the demand.\nHomeownership grew throughout the country during the second half of the 20th century and fueled the rise of the middle class. The Charter Act reorganized Fannie Mae from a government agency into a mixed ownership corporation in 1954.\nIn the 1968 Housing and Urban Development Act, Fannie Mae became a private shareholder-owned corporation chartered by the U.S. Congress. After being removed from the federal budget, Fannie Mae funded its operations through stock and bond markets.\nIn the 1980s, the development of mortgage-backed securities brought capital from global markets to the U.S. housing industry. Fannie Mae securitized mortgage loans and guaranteed payment to investors, which it continues to do today.\nHousing prices plummeted and delinquencies rose during the financial crisis, and the government-sponsored enterprises lost billions of dollars on investment portfolios and mortgage-backed security guarantees. The federal government put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nThe company returned to profitability in 2012.  In 2014, Fannie Mae had paid back all funds it received when it first went under conservatorship and has since put billions into the U.S. Treasury."

    "text": "While our role providing liquidity and stability to the residential mortgage market and promoting affordable access to mortgage credit has remained constant, we’ve strengthened our business model significantly since entering conservatorship. This makes us better able to withstand market fluctuations and respond to risk. And we’re better prepared to serve homebuyers and renters in good times and tough times.\nPreviously, we earned most of our revenue by holding a large investment portfolio of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Today, we have drastically reduced our portfolio and shifted to a more stable, guaranty fee-driven business model. Our model is focused on receiving a steady stream of monthly fees to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on the mortgage-backed securities we sell to American and global investors.\nAs we’ve transitioned our business model, we’ve achieved 13 straight years of annual profitability. We’ve now paid approximately $181 billion to the Treasury in senior preferred stock dividends, which is about $62 billion more than we have received in support from the government since 2008. And in just the past 5 years, when we’ve been permitted to retain our earnings, we’ve increased our net worth by over $81 billion, resulting in nearly $95 billion of net worth as of the end of 2024.\nWe provide financing every day to help strengthen the housing market, which contributes to the economy, job growth, and a better quality of life across America. Our role is even more critical in tough moments for the economy. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many other financial institutions held back their mortgage purchases, which would have prevented many people from securing a mortgage or refinancing. Fannie Mae stepped in and provided additional support, increasing our mortgage purchases to ensure a strong housing market and help the economy.\nAt the same time, we developed innovative and flexible tools for mortgage companies to help renters and homeowners impacted by the pandemic. For homeowners facing financial hardships, we offered the option to suspend or delay mortgage payments up to 18 months. We helped more than 1.4 million homeowners under this plan.\nFannie Mae stepped in during the pandemic to support access to homeownership\nTo help ensure we are able to meet the housing market’s needs in times of stress, the U.S. government has established rigorous bank-like capital requirements that we will be required to meet to allow us to operate during difficult economic periods. We are building our capital reserves to meet these requirements.\nAt the same time, since entering conservatorship, we’ve focused on improving the resilience and credit quality of the book of mortgages we guarantee. This greater resilience is shown in the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (known as DFAST) our regulator mandates that we conduct to assess our ability to withstand difficult economic conditions. Over the past few years, our DFAST results have shown limited or no pre-tax losses during severe economic downturn scenarios that were far worse than the 2008 financial crisis. This underscores the strength of our business and its ability to serve as a source of stability in the market today and in the future.\n12017 GAAP net income includes a $9.9B provision for federal income taxes resulting from the remeasurement of Fannie Mae’s deferred tax assets due to the corporate tax reduction in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n2Dividend payments do not reduce the senior preferred stock’s liquidation preference, which includes cumulative amounts drawn from Treasury.\n3For information on how these ratios are calculated and what they represent, see endnote 17 of ourQ4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Supplement.\n4U.S. G-SIB banks refers to United States global systemically important banks, as defined by the Financial Stability Board.

    "text": "If you operate a community land trust, below market rate program, or another program that uses income and resale price restrictions (deed restrictions) to create long-term affordability, certifying your program can help you offer your homebuyers more financing opportunities and save your lending partners time.\nFannie Mae's Shared Equity Program Platform allows you to quickly and easily show that you meet conventional financing requirements in as little as 10 minutes, expanding your customers' borrowing options.\nFannie Mae works with lenders to make financing more available to homebuyers purchasing from a shared equity program. In return, lenders confirm that programs they work with meet certain industry standards and program requirements. By answering a few simple questions, you can let lenders know that you meet those standards, opening up new opportunities for your homebuyers to finance their mortgage.\nTo complete the application you'll be asked to provide:\nOnce submitted, your application will be reviewed and you will be notified of the results. Assuming your program meets the necessary requirements, the program will be added to theCertified Shared Equity Programs List.\nGet started\nIf your program, for example, uses both a ground lease and also a deed restriction you’ll want to add both legal documents for review. Once you’ve completed the application for your first program (ground lease), you’ll have the option to add the additional legal document (deed restriction). Your contact information will appear and you’ll be able to edit any information, but you’ll need to continue through the same questions ensuring they’re accurate for the new legal document as details such as the term of the resale restrictions may be different. Please be aware that you will need to complete your submission in one sitting. Applications that have not been submitted will not be saved and you will be unable to return to an incomplete application at a later time.\nAs a best practice, if you don’t have all of your documents and information available when you initially complete the application, you may find it easier to complete the application for your ground lease and submit that application and then start a new application for the deed restriction document with a different application.\nYes, if you did not complete the form and submit your information, you will need to start the application form again.\nCheck that your browser is updated to the latest version. We also recommend using a browser other than Microsoft Edge, if possible.\nIf you still need help, reach out to[email protected].\nPlease contact[email protected]for assistance.\nIf your legal agreement between the program and homeowners (often a ground lease or deed restriction) is finalized, you can submit the application. There is no requirement to have existing units when you apply. If your program is certified, you will be responsible for providing updated documents if and when they change.\nWe ask this question to understand whether the organization listed in your initial contact information is the same as the organization named in the legal agreement between the homeowner and the program. This question does not seek to understand if your funder(s) are named within your legal documents—only whether the legal agreement is signed by the homeowner and your organization, or a different organization. This may be the case if a nonprofit organization is paid to administer, steward, or provide monitoring and compliance for a municipal or other nonprofit’s portfolio of affordable homeownership units."

That means there are more financing options for shared equity programs and homebuyers and fewer hurdles for lenders when offering shared equity loans.\nShared equity programs are sometimes referred to as Below-Market Rate programs.  There are three types of shared equity programs that we see regularly:  Community Land Trusts (CLTs), Deed Restricted or Income and Resale and Price Restricted programs, and Limited Equity Cooperatives.\nShared equity programs preserve affordable homeownership opportunities by allowing borrowers to purchase homes at below-market prices. In exchange, borrowers agree to sell the property only to other income-qualified buyers and at a restricted sales price.\nTo offer conventional financing for properties that are part of a shared equity program, lenders often have to invest resources in ensuring that the program meets certain requirements. By answering a few questions to certify that you meet Fannie Mae and Duty to Serve requirements, you can show lenders that the homes in your program are eligible for conventional financing.\nGet certified\nSee how Land Home Financial Solutions worked with the Housing Land Trust (HLT) of Sonoma County and other partners to make homeownership even more attainable by using MH Advantage homes in a recent development."

Discriminatory restrictive covenants were intended to prevent people of color from moving into certain neighborhoods. Although they are now illegal and unenforceable, some properties may still include discriminatory covenants in their historical record.\nThis page provides resources regarding discriminatory restrictive covenants on real estate, what they mean, and what property owners can do about them.\nA restrictive covenant is a provision on a Deed, Mortgage, or other recorded instrument that regulates the ownership or use of a parcel of real estate.\nNo, lawful uses of restrictive covenants include land use restrictions such as maintaining land for public parks or nature preserves, or permitting only single-family homes, or prohibiting industrial activities on the land.\nDiscriminatory restrictive covenants are clauses that prohibit the ownership, occupancy, or use of land based upon a particular trait, such as race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), family status, disability, or other protected classes.\nGenerally, yes.

The states listed below have adopted laws that make it easier to record documents to modify or remove discriminatory restrictive covenants from historical recorded documents such as deeds and mortgages. In other states, a court action might be necessary to obtain a judge’s order removing the discriminatory restrictive covenant. You may need to consult an attorney familiar with real estate records.Please remember that discriminatory restrictive covenants based on race, religion, national origin or sex are illegal and unenforceable.There is no obligation to remove the discriminatory restrictive covenant in order for all homeowners to enjoy the ownership and use of their properties regardless of their race, religion, national origin, or sex."

Since being chartered by Congress in 1970, we have fulfilled our mission to keep mortgage money flowing, support the stability of the housing market, and promote housing affordability. And we continue to lead the housing industry forward, building a better housing finance system – for today and for tomorrow.\nFreddie Mac operates in the U.S. secondary mortgage market. That means we don’t lend directly to borrowers but buy loans that meet our standards from approved lenders. With the money that lenders receive in return, they can make loans to other qualified borrowers. In securitizing pools of mortgages and selling the securities to investors, we shift a significant portion of the credit risk associated with the loans we own to private investors.\nWe conduct business through two business segments, the single-family business segment and the multifamily business segment. Those two segments are primarily supported by our Single-Family Division, Multifamily Division and Capital Markets Division.\nOur single-family business segment supports responsible, sustainable homeownership.\nOur single-family business segment supports responsible, sustainable homeownership. We do so primarily through the work of ourSingle-Family DivisionandCapital Markets Division.\nThose divisions work with lenders of all sizes – national, regional, and community lenders and credit unions – to buy conventional, conforming mortgage loans for one- to four-unit homes – including condominiums and manufactured homes – up to a certain dollar amount set by our regulator. As part of our mission, we are committed to creating homeownership opportunities for people hoping to buy a home for the first time, earning low and moderate incomes, and living in underserved markets.\nBecause lenders know they can sell loans to us, they are more willing to make long-term, fixed-rate loans, which make mortgage payments more affordable to more households. When a homeowner faces financial difficulties, we work with the lender to help the borrower avoid foreclosure, where possible, or exit homeownership as smoothly as possible.\nWe also promote liquidity and make funding more available to borrowers by purchasing mortgage-related securities guaranteed by Freddie Mac and other financial institutions as investments. We fund these investments by issuing corporate debt securities. Freddie Mac’s investors include but are not limited to central and commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies, and securities dealers from around the world.\nOur multifamily business segment supports affordable rental opportunities across the nation.\nOur multifamily business segment supports affordable rental opportunities across the nation, primarily through the work of ourMultifamily Divisionand capital markets activities within that group and theCapital Markets Division.\nWorking with a network of specialized lenders, Freddie Mac provides funding for loans on properties ranging from five units to hundreds of units across multiple buildings. We support all types of multifamily properties nationwide, including conventional, seniors, student, and subsidized housing as well as smaller properties and manufactured housing communities.\nOur funding is vital to making sure that renters have access to adequate, affordable apartment homes. Around 90 percent of the apartments we finance each year are affordable to low- or moderate-income renters. Multifamily borrowers mainly are commercial entities, such as property developers, and the properties are considered businesses. Our in-house teams closely oversee loan and property quality throughout the life of each loan.\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nMedia Room\nInvestor Relations\nCareers\nOur Suppliers\nOur Business\nSingle-Family Division\nMultifamily Division\nCapital Markets Division\nResources\nMortgage Lookup Tool\nRental Lookup Tool\nMy Home by Freddie Mac®\nCreditSmart®\nConnect With Us\nContact Us\nReport a Security or Privacy Incident\nSign up for news, tips, and insights"

Upon its appointment as Conservator, FHFA immediately succeeded to, among other things, the right of holders of our common stock to vote with respect to the election of directors. As a result, stockholders no longer have the ability to recommend director nominees or vote for the election of our directors. Instead, on an annual basis beginning in 2009, the Conservator has elected directors by a written consent in lieu of an annual meeting. Accordingly, we do not expect to hold stockholders' meetings during the conservatorship, nor will we prepare or provide proxy statements for the solicitation of proxies.\nOur Annual Meeting of Stockholders was held on Friday, June 6, 2008 at the Freddie Mac office located at 8000 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, VA 22102.\nMeeting Details & Related Materials\nOur Annual Meeting of Stockholders was held on Friday, June 8, 2007 at the Freddie Mac office located at 8000 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, VA 22102.\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nMedia Room\nInvestor Relations\nCareers\nOur Suppliers\nOur Business\nSingle-Family Division\nMultifamily Division\nCapital Markets Division\nResources\nMortgage Lookup Tool\nRental Lookup Tool\nMy Home by Freddie Mac®\nCreditSmart®\nConnect With Us\nContact Us\nReport a Security or Privacy Incident\nSign up for news, tips, and insights"

The Conservator has delegated to the Board and its committees authority to function in accordance with the duties and authorities set forth in applicable statutes, regulations, guidance, orders and directives and our Bylaws and Board committee charters, but reserved certain items that would require Conservator approval. On November 15, 2012, the Conservator revised and expanded the categories of items requiring Conservator approval, instructing the Board that it should oversee that management consults with and obtains approval of the Conservator before taking action in the following areas:\nFHFA has indicated that it expects the Board to review and approve all matters that will require Conservator approval before such matters are submitted to FHFA. In addition, FHFA is requiring timely notice of any planned changes in business processes or operations, including changes to single-family or multifamily credit policies and loss mitigation strategies that management has determined in its reasonable business judgment to be significant, other than changes made at the direction or request of FHFA. FHFA will then determine whether any such actions or plans require Conservator and/or Board review or approval.\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nMedia Room\nInvestor Relations\nCareers\nOur Suppliers\nOur Business\nSingle-Family Division\nMultifamily Division\nCapital Markets Division\nResources\nMortgage Lookup Tool\nRental Lookup Tool\nMy Home by Freddie Mac®\nCreditSmart®\nConnect With Us\nContact Us\nReport a Security or Privacy Incident\nSign up for news, tips, and insights"

Freddie Mac’s Codes of Conduct set critical expectations for our behavior, with separate versions that apply to employees and Directors. Freddie Mac is required to review its Codes of Conduct at least once every three years. Most recently, the Board of Directors approved the revision to the Board Code of Conduct on September 7, 2023 (including only formatting updates). On January 1, 2023, the Employee Code of Conduct was revised to highlight additional areas of focus (including Fair Lending and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) for the company and to generally refresh the document. On January 1, 2025, updates were made to the Employee Code of Conduct to clarify conflicts of interest and information risk expectations and included a leadership message from our new CEO.\nFreddie Mac's complaint policy for accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters pertaining to the company's business has been created in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. The policy establishes processes, and defines responsibilities for the receipt, retention and prompt resolution of complaints, including the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.\nCertain employees are required to abide with six-month cooling-off periods following their termination of their employment with Freddie Mac. The cooling-off periods restrict specific types of engagement with Freddie Mac on behalf of the former employees' new employers. Knowing violations of the cooling-off periods may result in legal action. Third Parties may direct any questions about these restrictions to theCompliance & Ethics Helpline.\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nMedia Room\nInvestor Relations\nCareers\nOur Suppliers\nOur Business\nSingle-Family Division\nMultifamily Division\nCapital Markets Division\nResources\nMortgage Lookup Tool\nRental Lookup Tool\nMy Home by Freddie Mac®\nCreditSmart®\nConnect With Us\nContact Us\nReport a Security or Privacy Incident\nSign up for news, tips, and insights"

Box 43078Providence, RI 02940-3078United States of America\nWebsite:https://www-us.computershare.com/investor\nUnder Freddie Mac's Congressional charter, the corporation's official name is Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. However, the Board of Directors has authorized the corporation to conduct business as Freddie Mac.\nFreddie Mac is a federally chartered corporation created by Congress on July 24, 1970.\nThe company's corporate headquarters is located in McLean, VA. Freddie Mac also operates five regional offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York.\nOn January 3, 1989, Freddie Mac stock was converted into a class of stock that could be owned and traded by all investors. (Prior to that date, ownership of the stock was limited by its terms to financial institutions and a small number of other parties.) On August 9, 1989, Congress amended Freddie Mac's charter to convert this class of stock into Voting Common Stock, granting its holders the right to elect 13 directors of the Company. The Voting Common Stock and its predecessors were listed on the New York Stock Exchange from 1984 through July 7, 2010, and began trading exclusively on the over-the-counter (OTC) market since July 8, 2010.\nBeginning on July 8, 2010, Freddie Mac common stock is exclusively traded on the OTC market.\nThe ticker symbol is FMCC.\nNo. Freddie Mac was chartered by Congress as a private company serving a public purpose. On September 6, 2008, the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), appointed FHFA as conservator of Freddie Mac. As conservator, FHFA has all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of Freddie Mac, and of any stockholder, officer, or director of Freddie Mac with respect to Freddie Mac and its assets; and title to the books, records and assets of Freddie Mac. In connection with the appointment of FHFA as conservator, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have entered into a Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement. As part of the agreement, Freddie Mac has issued senior preferred stock to Treasury, together with a warrant for the purchase of common stock representing 79.9% of Freddie Mac’s common stock.\nFreddie Mac ’s regulator is theFederal Housing Finance Agency(FHFA).  FHFA was established in 2008 as an independent government agency responsible for oversight of the operations of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Banks. In addition, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has fair housing authority over Freddie Mac.\nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae have substantially similar charters, Congressional mandates, and regulatory structures. Both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are publicly traded corporations. Ginnie Mae is a government-owned corporation within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that guarantees mortgage-backed securities backed by federally insured or guaranteed loans. Unlike Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae does not purchase mortgages from lenders, nor does it buy, sell, or issue securities.\nWe conduct business through two business segments, the single-family business segment and the multifamily business segment. Those two segments are primarily supported by our Single-Family Division, Multifamily Division, and Capital Markets Division.\nSingle-Family Business Segment\nOur single-family business segment supports responsible, sustainable homeownership. We do so primarily through the work of our Single- Family Division and Capital Markets Division.Those divisions work with lenders of all sizes – national, regional and community lenders and credit unions – to buy conventional, conforming mortgage loans for one- to four-unit homes – including condominiums and manufactured homes – up to a certain dollar amount set by our regulator. As part of our mission, we are committed to creating homeownership opportunities for people hoping to buy a home for the first time, earning low and moderate incomes and living in underserved markets.\nBecause lenders know they can sell loans to us, they are more willing to make long-term, fixed-rate loans, which make mortgage payments more affordable to more households. When a homeowner faces financial difficulties, we work with the lender to help the borrower avoid foreclosure, where possible, or exit homeownership as smoothly as possible.We also promote liquidity and make funding more available to borrowers by purchasing mortgage-related securities guaranteed by Freddie Mac and other financial institutions as investments. We fund these investments by issuing corporate debt securities. Freddie Mac's investors include, but are not limited to, central and commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies and securities dealers from around the world.\nMultifamily Business Segment\nOur multifamily business segment supports affordable rental opportunities across the nation, primarily through the work of our Multifamily Division and capital markets activities within that group and the Capital Markets Division.\nWorking with a network of specialized lenders, Freddie Mac provides funding for loans on properties ranging from five units to hundreds of units across multiple buildings. We support all types of multifamily properties nationwide, including conventional, seniors, student and subsidized housing as well as smaller properties and manufactured housing communities.\nOur funding is vital to making sure that renters have access to adequate, affordable apartment homes. Around 90 percent of the apartments we finance each year are affordable to low- or moderate-income renters. Multifamily borrowers mainly are commercial entities, such as property developers, and the properties are considered businesses. Our in-house teams closely oversee loan and property quality throughout the life of each loan.\nOn July 18, 2008, Freddie Mac registered its common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Freddie Mac files its period financial disclosure documents with the SEC via the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.\nPrior to Freddie Mac's voluntary registration of its common stock with the SEC on July 18, 2008, Freddie Mac did not file financial reports with the SEC and instead prepared Annual Information Statements and Quarterly Information Statement Supplements in lieu of Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, which are available from the company's Investor Relations Department.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) has been our auditor since March 6, 2002.\nAs announced by FHFA Director, James Lockhart, on September 7, 2008, all future common and preferred stock dividends would be eliminated, other than dividends on the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nFreddie Mac has had two common stock splits. The Board of Directors authorized a 3-for-1 stock split effective April 9, 1992 and a 4-for-1 stock split effective January 13, 1997.\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nMedia Room\nInvestor Relations\nCareers\nOur Suppliers\nOur Business\nSingle-Family Division\nMultifamily Division\nCapital Markets Division\nResources\nMortgage Lookup Tool\nRental Lookup Tool\nMy Home by Freddie Mac®\nCreditSmart®\nConnect With Us\nContact Us\nReport a Security or Privacy Incident\nSign up for news, tips, and insights"

We work with the Federal Housing Finance Agency to ensure all pilots are consistent with our charter and follow established governance processes.\nThe information below is designed to increase transparency around Freddie Mac’s active pilots and test-and-learns, in addition to those that were recently designated inactive.\nIn a housing market marked by high mortgage rates and low housing supply, second mortgages can offer substantial benefits for borrowers, lenders and the overall market — often at a lower risk than some alternatives such as a cash-out refinance. Freddie Mac is engaging in a limited pilot to purchase certain single-family closed-end second mortgages as part of a conditional approval by FHFA, which includes the following terms:\nUpon the pilot’s conclusion, FHFA will analyze the data on Freddie Mac’s purchases of second mortgages to determine whether the objectives of the pilot were met and next steps.\nPilot Scope:Limited rollout started in December 2024.Plan Alignment:N/APilot Status:Active\nTo work with Sellers on improving the quality of performing loans, the company will pilot a replacement to its current repurchase policy for defective performing loans. The pilot will use a fee-based structure that is more efficient, transparent and rewards lenders that deliver high-quality loans. Specifically, lenders will not be subject to repurchases on most performing loans and will instead be subject to a fee-based structure based on non-acceptable quality (NAQ) rates. The fee will apply uniformly to medium and large lenders based on NAQ rates and will be waived for smaller lenders that do not deliver a large enough volume to generate a statistically significant NAQ rate. Loans that are non-performing within 36 months or subject to life of loan defects will still be subject to repurchase. This fee structure will begin with a limited rollout with targeted lenders in early 2024.Pilot Scope:Limited rollout starting in early 2024.Plan Alignment:N/APilot Status:Active\nOur efforts focus on assessing enhancements for new and existing collateral valuation methods. The overarching objectives are to promote more consistent outcomes and maintain appropriate levels of risk management to mitigate the loss associated with default, while creating efficiencies that may save time and lower costs in the appraisal process.Pilot Scope:Limited to target set of lenders, ensuring participation of small and medium size lenders. Pilot is ongoing in 2025.Plan Alignment:N/APilot Status:Active\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused hardships for millions of homeowners, many of who took advantage of forbearance. However, due to long-term or permanent changes in household composition and earnings, we expect some homeowners may require payment relief beyond existing offerings to stay in their homes when their forbearance expires. The Shared Equity Conversion pilot provides eligible distressed borrowers the option to opt-in to shared equity homeownership, in coordination with a loan modification, to receive deeper payment relief and keep their homes.Pilot Scope:The pilot was capped at a fixed number of loans modified. The pilot began in 2022 and has concluded.Plan Alignment:N/APilot Status:Inactive\nAIM for Direct Deposit confirms that a borrower has sufficient income capacity to meet payment obligations, leveraging direct deposits identified from 12-24 months from financial institution account data. This improves risk management. It also reduces the paper documentation burden on borrowers, speeding up loan closings and simplifying the lending process.Pilot Scope:The pilot was capped at a fixed number of loans delivered to Freddie Mac.

The survey is based on first-lien prime conventional conforming home purchase mortgages with a loan-to-value of 80 percent. In addition, the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) products are indexed to U.S. Treasury yields and lenders are asked for both the initial coupon rate and points as well as the margin on the ARM products.\nLenders surveyed each week are a mix of lender types – credit unions, commercial banks and mortgage lending companies – is roughly proportional to the level of mortgage business that each type commands nationwide.\nAs of November 17, 2022, the process for gathering the data was updated. Instead of surveying lenders, the Primary Mortgage Market Survey®results are now based on actual applications from lenders across the country that are submitted to Freddie Mac when a borrower applies for a mortgage.\nAdditionally, we will no longer publish fees/points or adjustable rates.\nThe survey is collected from Thursday through Wednesday and the results are released on Thursdays at 12 p.m. ET.\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

In 1984, the 1-year ARM was added to the survey and the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage rate was included beginning in 1991. In January 2005, Freddie Mac added a 5/1 hybrid ARM series to the survey. In January 2016, the 1-year ARM was discontinued.\nThe mortgage rate gathering process was updated with the November 17th, 2022 release of the newly enhanced PMMS®. Instead of surveying lenders, we now use data from our Loan Product Advisor®(LPASM). Therefore, the PMMS®results are now based on the mortgage rate collected from thousands of loan applications submitted to Freddie Mac from lenders across the country when a borrower applies for a mortgage. Additionally, we discontinued adjustable rates and fees/points. Please see theResearch Notefor more detailed information.\nThe newly enhanced PMMS®is published each Thursday at noon ET. When a U.S. holiday falls on a Thursday, the PMMS will publish on the Wednesday of that week.\nThe week of application activity starts at 12:00 a.m. ET the prior Thursday and lasts through 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday. Therefore, the PMMS®results are an average of loan rates offered Thursday through Wednesday.\nCurrently, our lenders are a mix of credit unions, commercial banks, and mortgage lending companies.\nWe collect the mortgage rate of all purchase applications based on PMMS®criteria and a national average mortgage rate is calculated out of all the selected loan applications. The criteria include weekly conventional, single-family originations with conforming loan limits as set by FHFA.\nPMMS®rates are based on applications submitted to Freddie Mac for the given week from lenders across the country.\nARMs indexed to alternatives to U.S. Treasury securities have become more prevalent in the market. As we worked on enhancing the PMMS®, we carefully considered which loan products were most popular for the PMMS®borrower profile (good/excellent credit, 20% loans, home purchase loans on owner occupied 1-unit single-family properties). Additionally, in recent years the mortgage market has been dominated by fixed mortgage products. While there has been an uptick recently in the share of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) for the broader mortgage market, ARMs remain most popular for higher loan size (nonconforming) loans.\nUnder the current LPA requirements, fees and points are not always required to be provided by lenders. Therefore, we are not able to report on the average fees and points.\nThe PMMS®is available on Freddie Mac's web site (www.freddiemac.com) under Mortgage Rates.\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

This increase was primarily driven by higher net interest income from continued mortgage portfolio growth and lower funding costs partially offset by lower yields on short-term investments.\nOur first quarter net interest income was $5.1 billion, up $343 million, or 7 percent year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued mortgage portfolio growth in Single-Family and an increase in the volume of fully guaranteed securitizations in Multifamily.\nNon-interest income for the first quarter was $750 million, a decline of $248 million, or 25 percent lower from the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains in Multifamily.\nNon-interest expense declined $34 million, or 2 percent, year-over-year, primarily due to lower credit enhancement expenses driven by lower volume of cumulative credit risk transfer transactions.\nOur provision for credit losses was $280 million for this quarter, primarily driven by a credit reserve build in Single-Family attributable to new acquisitions.\nSingle-Family Business Segment\nTurning to our individual business segments, the Single-Family segment reported net income of $2.3 billion for the quarter, up $316 million, or 16 percent year-over-year.\nSingle-Family net revenues of $4.9 billion increased 10 percent from the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily driven by a 6 percent increase in our net interest income, which benefited from continued mortgage portfolio growth. Our Single-Family mortgage portfolio at the end of the quarter was $3.1 trillion, up 2 percent year-over-year.\nOur provision for single-family credit losses was an expense of $228 million this quarter, primarily due to a credit reserve build for new acquisitions. The provision in the prior year quarter was $120 million, which was primarily attributable to new acquisitions and increasing mortgage interest rates.\nOur current house price forecast assumes an increase of 4.2 percent over the next 12 months and 2.8 percent over the subsequent 12 months. This is a change from our forecast at the end of last quarter, which assumed 2.7 percent and 3.3 percent growth over the next 12 and subsequent 12 months, respectively.\nThe Single-Family allowance for credit losses coverage ratio at the end of this quarter was 21 basis points, unchanged from last quarter and up 1 basis point year-over-year.\nNew business activity totaled $78 billion this quarter, up from $62 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Both home purchase and refinance activity increased due to higher market coverage and conforming loan limits – as well as house price appreciation in recent quarters. Refinance activity accounted for 21 percent of our total new business activity this quarter, up from 15 percent in the same quarter last year as we saw mortgage rates come down throughout the quarter.\nThe 30-year mortgage rate at the end of the quarter was 6.65 percent, down from 6.85 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and from 6.79 percent at the end of the first quarter 2024. First-time homebuyers represented 52 percent of our total new business activity, or 81,000 households, in the first quarter.\nThe average estimated guarantee fee charged on new business was 54 basis points, while the weighted average original loan-to-value on new purchases was 77 percent, and the weighted average original credit score was 756.\nCredit characteristics of our Single-Family mortgage portfolio remained strong as well, with the weighted average current loan-to-value ratio at 52 percent and the weighted average current credit score at 754.\nAt the end of the quarter, 62 percent of our Single-Family mortgage portfolio had some form of credit enhancement.\nThe Single-Family serious delinquency rate remained low at 59 basis points, unchanged from the prior quarter and up 7 basis points from the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a higher serious delinquency rate for loans originated during and after 2022 as well as lingering impacts from hurricanes that occurred late in 2024. On a related note, in the first quarter, we helped approximately 25,000 families remain in their homes through loan workouts.\nMultifamily Business Segment\nMoving on to Multifamily, the segment reported net income of $533 million dollars, which is down $288 million – or 35 percent – from the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lower non-interest income of $585 million, which decreased $427 million from prior the year quarter. It also was driven by lower revenues from held-for-sale loan purchases and securitization activities, impacts from interest-rate management activities, and less favorable fair value changes from prepayment rates.\nNet interest income of $349 million was up 29 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in the volume of fully guaranteed securitizations.\nThe Multifamily provision for credit losses was an expense of $52 million this quarter versus $61 million in the prior year quarter.\nOur Multifamily new business activity was $10 billion for the first quarter, up $1 billion from a year ago. Our Multifamily business provided financing for 89,000 multifamily rental units in the quarter, with 66 percent of eligible rental units affordable to low-income families.\nAlso in the first quarter, we securitized $16 billion of multifamily loans, $5 billion more than in the prior year quarter. Fully guaranteed securitizations represented 56 percent of total securitizations, up from 36 percent in the first quarter 2024. The average guarantee fee on our total guarantee portfolio increased 5 basis points year-over-year to 52 basis points.\nOur Multifamily mortgage portfolio increased 5 percent year-over-year to $467 billion.\nThe Multifamily delinquency rate at end of the quarter was 46 basis points. This was up 12 basis points from 34 basis points at the end of March 2024 and up 6 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase in the delinquency rate was primarily driven by increased delinquencies in our floating rate loans, including small balance loans that are in their floating rate period. Ninety-eight percent of these delinquent loans had credit enhancement coverage at the end of the quarter. At the Multifamily mortgage portfolio level, our credit enhancement coverage was 93 percent.\nCapital\nOn the capital front, our net worth increased to $62.4 billion dollars at the end of the quarter, representing a 24 percent increase year-over-year.\nLet me conclude by noting that many of you are closely following the announcements and orders issued by Director Pulte and what those mean for Freddie Mac.\nBriefly, Director Pulte has helped us streamline our business and harness the productivity of thousands of Freddie Mac employees now in the office full-time.\nHe has eliminated activities not central to Freddie Mac’s mission, as well as requirements that may make it more expensive to finance a loan, but which might provide little tangible benefit to the majority of American renters and homebuyers. We support actions he has taken to drive fraud and waste out of the U.S. housing finance system.\nWe expect the savings associated with FHFA’s new direction to reduce Freddie Mac’s general and administrative expenses in 2025 and beyond. Furthermore, we believe that regulatory changes making it easier for us to responsibly acquire loans will increase our revenue and enable us to provide even greater liquidity to the single-familyandmultifamily market.\nThat should enable Freddie Mac to invest more in critical technology, increase our net worth, and lower the cost of originating a mortgage.\nTaking a step back, the Director has challenged us to create a more affordable U.S. housing system. We are committed to rising to that challenge.\n©2025 by Freddie Mac.\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nJim Whitlinger is executive vice president and chief financial officer.

Residential fixed investment fell 4.3% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate marking the second consecutive decline since the very strong 13.7% growth in Q1. However, consumers, the backbone of U.S. economic growth, remained strong with personal consumption expenditures increasing 3.7% in Q3 2024. This is the fastest pace of consumer spending growth since Q1 2023. Consumer spending contributed 2.5% to the 3.1% growth in total Real GDP growth for the third quarter.\nThe labor market ended the year on a good note, as December saw payroll gains of 256,000 compared to 212,000 in November, per the latest employment report of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Strong job growth gains in December were mostly due to gains in healthcare and leisure/hospitality, as well as a rebound in retail. Overall job growth for 2024 was 2.2 million with an average gain of 186,000 per month. Job gains in the pandemic recovery, at 29 million have been the largest in history after any recession, with the second largest gains of 24 million in the 2001 recovery (Exhibit 1). The unemployment rate remains low at 4.1% in December, ticking down from 4.2% in November.\nEnlarge Image\nU.S. inflation, after a slight uptick in October, held steady in November. Core inflation as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), less food and energy, rose 0.1% over the month in November and 2.8% from a year ago. Prices for goods were unchanged over the month. Inflation for services slowed to 0.2% month-over-month as compared to 0.4% last month and was at its slowest pace since May. While inflation has cooled from the highs seen in 2022, it remains above the Federal Reserve target of 2%.\nEconomic growth for 2024 was stronger than expected at the beginning of the year even in the face of high interest rates and high inflation. The labor market eased with demand and supply more balanced now than at the beginning of 2024. Inflation might take longer than initially expected to move towards the Fed’s target of 2%.\nU.S. housing and mortgage market:Despite rising interest rates, home sales increased in November 2024. Total (new + existing) home sales increased 4.9% from October. Existing home sales increased 6.1% from last year to 4.15 million, the fastest pace since June 2021. New home sales increased in November to 664,000, a seasonally adjusted annual rate, offsetting the declines in October due to hurricanes Helene and Milton. The month’s supply of existing homes decreased further from 4.2 months in October to a 3.8-month supply at the current sales pace in November.\nHousing construction slowed in November. Total housing starts declined 1.8% from October and 14.6% from last November. The slowdown was primarily due to a slowdown in multifamily construction, which decreased 28.8% from last November. Homebuilder confidence held steady at an index value of 46 in December, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ Housing Market Index. Builders are hopeful for an improvement in the regulatory environment for building, but confidence remains weak due to the chance of higher financing costs in the future. The index remains below 50, indicating that building conditions are expected to remain weak in the near term.2\nHouse price appreciation continued to slow from the highs witnessed in 2022. As measured by the FHFA House Price Index, U.S. house prices in October 2024 rose 0.4% month-over-month and 4.5% from last year. All nine census divisions showed annual increases; however, three divisions posted monthly price decreases. Limited housing inventory continues to drive house prices higher, as do elevated mortgage rates affecting affordability, which is weakening demand.\nMortgage rates remained elevated throughout December, ending the month at 6.85%. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage measured by Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey®averaged 6.72% in December. With rates moving higher and reaching a time of the year when mortgage activity typically slows, there were declines for both refinance and purchase activity. Refinance activity decreased throughout December. Purchase activity decreased 15.4% in the last week of December compared to the last week of November.\nIn terms of mortgage performance, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s mortgage delinquency survey, a seasonally adjusted (SA) 3.92% of outstanding mortgage debt was in some stage of delinquency as of Q3 2024, down five basis points from Q2 2024 but up 30 basis points year-over-year. Loans 30+ days delinquent decreased 14 basis points from 2.26% in Q2 2024 to 2.12% in Q3 2024 and rose nine basis points from Q3 2023. Loans in foreclosure increased two basis points from last quarter to 0.45% in Q3 2024 and decreased four basis points year-over-year (SA). In terms of seriously delinquent loans (90 days or more past due or in foreclosure), the overall share increased from 1.43% in Q2 to 1.55% in Q3 2024 and were up three basis points from Q3 2023. Shown inExhibit 2, VA loans saw an uptick from 2.07% in Q2 2024 to 2.26% in Q3 2024 and were up from 1.99% in Q2 2023, non-seasonally adjusted (NSA). The share of conventional loans was up from 1.04% in Q2 to 1.09% in Q3 2024, down from 1.12% in Q3 2023 and the share of FHA loans increased from 3.17% to 3.63% during the second and third quarter of the year and up from 3.34% in Q3 2023 (NSA).\nEnlarge Image\nOur outlook for the U.S. economy in 2025 is positive, though we expect the pace of growth to moderate. In late 2024, the U.S. labor market started showing signs of cooling and we expect that to persist in 2025. Modestly higher unemployment and slower job gains will reduce some of the pressures on inflation.\nMortgage rates remained higher than expected in 2024. Unlike last year when many were anticipating that mortgage rates would decline, in early 2025 the prevailing sentiment is that rates will stay higher for longer. This may impact prospective buyers and sellers as we get into spring. While last year, prospective buyers and sellers anticipating rate declines may have stayed on the sidelines waiting for lower rates, this year, they may make a move earlier as they are not expecting rates to move lower. This should increase home sales relative to last year, though the absolute level of sales is still likely to remain well below historical averages.\nThe rate lock-in effect is also expected to cool off in the new year, adding more inventory to the market. Our estimate of the average interest rate lock-in effect for conventional mortgage borrowers was up to $47,800 in November 2024, which is up from an estimated $42,000 in October 2024, but significantly below its peak of over $65,000 in October 2023. Even if mortgage rates stay flat or decline modestly, amortization of mortgage balances will bring down the lock-in effect and make it more palatable for potential home sellers to list their property despite having a low mortgage rate.\nIn 2025, we expect the pace of house price appreciation to moderate from the levels seen in 2024, while still maintaining a positive trajectory. This positive house price growth, coupled with increased home sales, is expected to drive purchase volumes higher than in 2024. The slightly lower rates in 2025 as compared to last year should also lead to higher refinance volumes. This increase in both purchase and refinance volumes is likely to boost total origination volumes in 2025, offering a promising outlook for 2025.\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\nSam Khater, Chief EconomistLen Kiefer, Deputy Chief EconomistAjita Atreya, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerRama Yanamandra, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerPenka Trentcheva, Macro & Housing Economics SeniorGenaro Villa, Macro & Housing Economics SeniorCaroline Cheatham, Finance Analyst\nwww.freddiemac.com/research\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

Throughout the history of the PMMS, we have adjusted the methodology to account for changes in technology and the mortgage industry while maintaining continuity with historical rates. In order to ensure that the PMMS continues to provide high-quality information on the mortgage market, we are making new enhancements to our methodology.\nIn this Research Note, we provide details of the adjustments and explain how the changes may impact users of the PMMS. We also discuss how the adjustments in methodology would have impacted historical PMMS results had we implemented these changes at an earlier date. While the methodological changes will set up the PMMS for continued success in years to come, the total impact on rates is currently very small, as we document below.\nFreddie Mac has been surveying lenders on weekly mortgage rates since 1971.1The survey included discount points and origination fees for 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate and 5/1 hybrid amortizing adjustable-rate mortgage products.\nThe survey captures mortgage rates for first-lien, conventional, conforming, purchase mortgages with a borrower who has a loan-to-value of 80% and excellent credit. In addition, it captures adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates indexed to U.S. Treasury yields. The lenders surveyed are asked for both the initial coupon rate and points as well as the margin on the ARM products. The lenders represent a mix of business models—credit unions, commercial banks, and mortgage lending companies—roughly proportional to the level of mortgage business each type commands nationwide. The rates are collected from Monday through Wednesday, and the results are released on Thursdays at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).\nThere have been growing challenges with the traditional survey approach. The current survey operates on sampled data where a subset of records in the overall population is selected. As the underlying population changes in response to economic conditions and the evolution of the mortgage market, the survey faces a variety of issues that could result in statistical bias and eventually reduce the reliability of the results.\nWhile our survey carefully samples lenders covering a broad range of lender types to reflect the U.S. mortgage market, we had to make frequent adjustments to our selection process to reflect changes in the housing market. The entry and exit of new participants into and out of the mortgage market creates more complexity in accurately tracking the market with a traditional survey method.\nMany institutions have turned to administrative datasets to supplement or replace survey methods. Administrative datasets are data collected by governments or other organizations for non-statistical reasons to provide overviews on registration, transactions, and record keeping. To enhance the PMMS, we have also decided to turn to administrative data, leveraging Freddie Mac’s vast data resources to estimate weekly mortgage rates. For the long-run viability of the PMMS, Freddie Mac has enhanced the PMMS methodology to improve the quality—as well as reliability and consistency—of its results.\nFor the long-run viability\nof the PMMS, Freddie Mac has enhanced the PMMS methodology to improve the quality—as well as reliability and consistency—of its results.\nGoing forward, the traditional survey approach will be replaced with loan application information submitted to Freddie Mac’s automated underwriting system, Loan Product Advisor® (LPA). LPA helps simplify the origination processes and provides lenders with greater certainty of meeting Freddie Mac’s eligibility requirements.\nThe loan application data is extensive and contains various information about the property being considered for purchase, the borrower’s financial situation, employment history, and more.\nIn general, mortgage rates are determined by a combination of various factors such as current economic conditions, the lender’s risk appetite and overhead costs, and borrowers’ credit profiles. However, the application data is neither a pledge by the applicant nor a commitment by the lender.\nThere are many advantages of using loan application data instead of a survey, including the dramatic increases in coverage and a real-time view of the mortgage market. The loan application data also covers a broad range of lenders and geographies in the United States and immediately and automatically adjusts to shifts in the composition of the mortgage market. While the current PMMS in recent years has captured mortgage rates reported by lenders in a majority of states, the loan application covers lenders in all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, on a weekly basis.\nAlthough there are many advantages of using loan application data to measure the mortgage rate, it comes with a cost. First, we do not have the information on the mortgage rate when lenders do not intend to sell to the secondary market or if they do not use the LPA as the underwriting tool.\nAs noted above, we measure the mortgage rate not in the origination but in the application stage. Therefore, our reported rate does not represent the rate at the time of loan origination. Not all applications will necessarily be approved and result in originated loans. Users should be aware of these factors when using the PMMS.\nIn addition, using LPA will result in two major changes related to our PMMS output:\nWe will not include the ARM products rate due to insufficient numbers of applicants with ARM programs in recent years in LPA data.\nThe cessation of reporting average points and fees merits some further discussion. Since LPA does not capture discount points or origination fees, we are not able to report them in the PMMS going forward. The full cost of a mortgage is captured by both the interest rate and the discount points and origination fees paid by a borrower. Theoretically, a borrower who pays discount points would receive a lower rate compared to the rate they would receive if they paid no points. However, in practice, we have found that in recent years the difference in rate between a borrower paying discount points and borrowers who do not pay discount points has been very near to zero.\nConsider Exhibit 1. We analyzed loans funded by Freddie Mac where the loan meets the PMMS profile and the closing date was between 2018 and 2021—then segmented the data into two sets: (1) borrowers who purchased discount points and (2) borrowers who did not purchase discount points. We found that for purchase transactions, mortgage rates are nearly the same regardless of whether borrowers purchased discount points. We found similar outcomes in refinance and cash- out refinance, where average mortgage rates did not change regardless of whether borrowers purchased discount points.2\nEnlarge Image\nOur main goal is to capture the average interest rate from loan applications submitted to Freddie Mac’s LPA tool. In order to align with the historical PMMS approach, we will limit the selection of loan applications to conventional, conforming, fully amortizing home purchase loans for borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit.\nAt first, we collect all purchase loan applications that could result in future home purchases. Next, we clean the data by removing irrelevant, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, and incomplete data. Then, we deduplicate the transactions to extract the most recent submissions after eliminating the transactions with outliers.\nThen, we select the loan applications meeting the following criteria:\nWe selected these loan features to maximize the compatibility between our new approach and the historical survey-based PMMS.\nLastly, we applied several additional rules to calculate the timely mortgage rate. In LPA, a lender may submit the same application multiple times in the loan application stage. Therefore, in our final selection, we keep only the existing applicants when their rates have changed compared to prior submissions, while we include all new applicants. By selecting only new applicants and existing applicants only if their rate change, we ensure our measure represents the most recent rate in the current mortgage market.\nSpecifically, we:\nGoing forward, the PMMS will be published weekly each Thursday at 12 p.m. ET. When a U.S. holiday falls on a Thursday, the PMMS will publish on the Wednesday of that week.\nThe week of application activity starts at 12:00 a.m. ET the Thursday of last week and goes through 11:59p.m. ET the following Wednesday. We collect the mortgage rate of all purchase applications that meet our weekly criteria and calculate the average mortgage rate.\nEnlarge Image\nIn preparation for launching the newly enhanced  PMMS, we created a complete weekly time series dating back to January 2005, when the loan application data collected from LPA was considered reliable for PMMS purposes. As we applied the same filters to the historical data as to the real-time data, the weekly releases are aligned with the same data-generation process as the historical series. This allowed us to construct a time series of weekly rates that would have been published  if the new methodology had been applied historically in real-time.\nWe find that the new methodology based on loan applications tracks very closely with our historical survey approach. On average, the difference between the traditional survey approach and the new approach for the 30-year FRM rate is about 0.066 percentage points from 2005 through 2021, with a standard deviation of about 0.074 percentage points. See Exhibit 3 below.\nEnlarge Image\nWe conducted a similar experiment for the 15-year FRM; see Exhibit 4 below. On average, the difference between the traditional survey approach and the new approach for the 15-year FRM rate is about 0.0475 percentage points from 2005 through 2021, with a standard deviation of about 0.069 percentage points.\nEnlarge Image\nThe very small difference in the rates reported in our historical survey and the real-time estimate of the new LPA-based approach give us great confidence in using the new approach. We also tested our results with other loan datasets purchased from third parties applying the same PMMS filters. The average rate computed using the new PMMS methodology and in the third-party data filtered to match the PMMS were quite similar. Finally, we assessed the results with the closed loans funded by Freddie Mac collected from the Uniform Closing Dataset after applying the same PMMS filters and we received comparable results.\nThe very small difference in the rates reported in our historical survey and the real-time estimate of the new LPA-based approach give us great confidence in using the new approach.\nBy using comprehensive and timely loan application data, our enhanced PMMS will produce a more reliable and accurate mortgage rate. Instead of surveying lenders, the weekly mortgage rate will be based on thousands of applications submitted to Freddie Mac from lenders across the country. We believe this improved PMMS will reflect the broader market and be able to monitor the real-time mortgage rate more closely.\nWe believe this improved PMMS will reflect the broader market and be able to monitor the real- time mortgage rate closely.\nPMMS users interested in time series properties using the new methodology are encouraged to submit thisformto receive a file containing the historical real-time estimates displayed in Exhibits 3 and 4 above.\nPMMS data users with questions about the methodological change are encouraged to reach out to us at[email protected].\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\nSam Khater, Chief Economist\nLen Kiefer, Deputy Chief Economist\nMihwa Kim, Macro Housing Economics Director\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

Since being chartered by Congress in 1970, we have fulfilled our mission to keep mortgage money flowing, support the stability of the housing market, and promote housing affordability. And we continue to lead the housing industry forward, building a better housing finance system – for today and for tomorrow.\nFreddie Mac operates in the U.S. secondary mortgage market. That means we don’t lend directly to borrowers but buy loans that meet our standards from approved lenders. With the money that lenders receive in return, they can make loans to other qualified borrowers. In securitizing pools of mortgages and selling the securities to investors, we shift a significant portion of the credit risk associated with the loans we own to private investors.\nWe conduct business through two business segments, the single-family business segment and the multifamily business segment. Those two segments are primarily supported by our Single-Family Division, Multifamily Division and Capital Markets Division.\nOur single-family business segment supports responsible, sustainable homeownership.\nOur single-family business segment supports responsible, sustainable homeownership. We do so primarily through the work of ourSingle-Family DivisionandCapital Markets Division.\nThose divisions work with lenders of all sizes – national, regional, and community lenders and credit unions – to buy conventional, conforming mortgage loans for one- to four-unit homes – including condominiums and manufactured homes – up to a certain dollar amount set by our regulator. As part of our mission, we are committed to creating homeownership opportunities for people hoping to buy a home for the first time, earning low and moderate incomes, and living in underserved markets.\nBecause lenders know they can sell loans to us, they are more willing to make long-term, fixed-rate loans, which make mortgage payments more affordable to more households. When a homeowner faces financial difficulties, we work with the lender to help the borrower avoid foreclosure, where possible, or exit homeownership as smoothly as possible.\nWe also promote liquidity and make funding more available to borrowers by purchasing mortgage-related securities guaranteed by Freddie Mac and other financial institutions as investments. We fund these investments by issuing corporate debt securities. Freddie Mac’s investors include but are not limited to central and commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies, and securities dealers from around the world.\nOur multifamily business segment supports affordable rental opportunities across the nation.\nOur multifamily business segment supports affordable rental opportunities across the nation, primarily through the work of ourMultifamily Divisionand capital markets activities within that group and theCapital Markets Division.\nWorking with a network of specialized lenders, Freddie Mac provides funding for loans on properties ranging from five units to hundreds of units across multiple buildings. We support all types of multifamily properties nationwide, including conventional, seniors, student, and subsidized housing as well as smaller properties and manufactured housing communities.\nOur funding is vital to making sure that renters have access to adequate, affordable apartment homes. Around 90 percent of the apartments we finance each year are affordable to low- or moderate-income renters. Multifamily borrowers mainly are commercial entities, such as property developers, and the properties are considered businesses. Our in-house teams closely oversee loan and property quality throughout the life of each loan.\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nMedia Room\nInvestor Relations\nCareers\nOur Suppliers\nOur Business\nSingle-Family Division\nMultifamily Division\nCapital Markets Division\nResources\nMortgage Lookup Tool\nRental Lookup Tool\nMy Home by Freddie Mac®\nCreditSmart®\nConnect With Us\nContact Us\nReport a Security or Privacy Incident\nSign up for news, tips, and insights"

We delivered our strongest earnings since 2021. Our net worth reached nearly $60 billion dollars. And we continued to employ strategies that help families stay in their homes and enhance Freddie Mac’s safety and soundness.\nOverall, this strong financial performance and attention to risk management contributes to liquidity and stability in the U.S. housing finance system.\nWe also continued to support other market participants. For example, last year alone, Freddie Mac acquired more than 1 million loans from over 1,000 lenders of all sizes across the country. We packaged those loans into mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, that attracted investors from around the world to support U.S. housing.\nWe purchased loans for cash and issued MBS totaling more than $411 billion dollars in 2024, up 18 percent from 2023. The proceeds enabled Freddie Mac to help nearly 1.6 million families buy, refinance or rent a home. Moreover, 52 percent of the primary home purchases we financed went to first-time homebuyers. And 53 percent of all the home loans we financed were affordable to low-and-moderate income families, as were 92 percent of all the apartment units we financed.\nNow let’s take a deeper look at the financial results making this possible.\nThis morning we reported full-year net income of $11.9 billion dollars, an increase of 13 percent from the prior year, and comprehensive income of $11.9 billion dollars, an increase of 11 percent from the prior year. These increases were primarily driven by higher net revenues, which were partially offset by a credit reserve build compared to a benefit for credit losses in the prior period in our Single-Family business.\nFull-year net revenues of $23.9 billion dollars were up $2.7 billion dollars, or 13 percent, year over year. Our 2024 net interest income of $19.7 billion dollars was up 6 percent year over year primarily driven by continued mortgage portfolio growth, which rose 3 percent year over year, and lower funding costs driven by our increase in our net worth, which grew by 25 percent year over year.\nNon-interest income was $4.2 billion for full-year 2024, up 55 percent year over year, primarily driven by higher revenues from held-for-sale loan purchase and securitization activities, and lower realized losses on sales of available-for-sale securities and other net investment gains.\nProvision for credit losses was an expense of $0.5 billion dollars for full-year 2024, primarily driven by a credit reserve build in Single-Family attributable to new acquisitions.\nOur non-interest expenses were down 3 percent year over year, to 8.7 billion dollars, as 2023 non-interest expense included an expense accrual of $313 million dollars related to a previously reported adverse litigation judgement.\nOur total mortgage portfolio grew 3 percent year over year to $3.6 trillion dollars at the end of 2024, driven by a 2 percent increase in our Single-Family mortgage portfolio and a 6 percent increase in our Multifamily mortgage portfolio.\nFourth Quarter Results\nTurning to our Fourth Quarter 2024 results, we reported net income of $3.2 billion dollars, an increase of $308 million or 11 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in net income was primarily driven by higher revenues which were partially offset by a credit reserve build in the Single-Family business.\nNet revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $6.3 billion dollars, an increase of $956 million dollars, or 18 percent, year over year, driven by increases in both net interest income and non-interest income.\nFourth quarter net interest income of $5.1 billion dollars was up 6 percent from the prior year quarter. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by continued mortgage portfolio growth and lower funding costs due to increasing net worth.\nProvision for credit losses was an expense of $92 million dollars for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to a benefit for credit losses of $467 million dollars for the fourth quarter of 2023. The credit loss provision expense this quarter was primarily driven by a reserve build in both of our business segments primarily attributable to new acquisitions, while in the prior year quarter it was driven by a credit reserve release in our Single-Family business due to an improvement in house prices.\nSingle-Family Results\nTurning to our individual business segments, Single-Family reported full-year net income of $9.4 billion dollars, an increase of $318 million dollars, or 4 percent, from the prior year.\nThis increase in net income primarily was driven by an increase in net revenues, which grew 8 percent year over year, or $1.6 billion dollars, to $19.8 billion dollars. This increase in net revenues was driven by increases in both net interest income and non-interest income. Net interest income of $18.5 billion dollars, was up 5 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by continued mortgage portfolio growth and lower funding costs due to higher net worth. Non-interest income was $1.3 billion dollars, up from $610 million dollars from 2023. This was primarily driven by impacts from interest rate risk management activities and spread-related gains.\nProvision for credit losses was an expense of $374 million dollars for 2024, primarily driven by a credit reserve build attributable to new acquisitions. The benefit for credit losses of $1.2 billion dollars for 2023 was primarily driven by a credit reserve release due to improvements in house prices.\nHouse prices increased 4 percent in 2024 compared to a 6.8 percent increase in 2023. Our current forecast assumes house prices will grow by 2.7 percent over the next 12 months and 3.3 percent over the subsequent 12 months, whereas our December 2023 forecast assumed an increase of 2.8 percent in the next 12 months followed by 2 percent growth in the subsequent 12 months.\nThe Single-Family allowance for credit losses coverage ratio at the end of the year was 21 basis points, 1 basis point higher than a year earlier.\nFull-year new business activity was $346 billion dollars, up $46 billion dollars, or 15 percent, from 2023 as both refinance and purchase activity increased during the year. Home purchase volume of $286 billion dollars accounted for 83 percent of our total new business activity for the year.\nMortgage rates remained higher in 2024 with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate peaking at 7.2 percent in May of 2024. According to our mortgage market survey, the average rate for the 30-year fixed at the end of 2024 was 6.85 percent up from 6.61 percent on December 31, 2023.\nAs I noted earlier, first-time homebuyers represented 52 percent of new Single-Family home loan purchases. The average net guarantee fee rate charged on new business was 55 basis points, down 1 basis point from 2023. The credit characteristics of our new business remained strong with an average estimated loan-to-value ratio of 77 percent and a weighted average credit score of 755.\nOur Single-Family mortgage portfolio increased 2 percent year-over-year to $3.1 trillion dollars at the end of 2024.\nOur Single-Family portfolio credit characteristics remained strong, with the weighted average current loan-to-value ratio at 52 percent and the weighted average current credit score at 755. Our Single-Family serious delinquency rate was 59 basis points as of December 31, 2024, up 4 bps from 55 basis points at the end of 2023. This increase in the serious delinquency rate was primarily due to recent hurricanes. We have historically observed temporary increases in delinquency rates following such events.\nDuring the year, we helped approximately 77,000 families remain in their homes through loan workouts.\nAt the end of the year, 62 percent of our Single-Family portfolio had some form of credit enhancement.\nMultifamily Results\nMoving to Multifamily, the business reported full-year net income of $2.5 billion dollars, up $1 billion dollars, or 67 percent, from the prior year. This was primarily driven by both higher net revenues and lower provision for credit losses in 2024.\nFull year net revenues of $4.1 billion dollars increased 38 percent year over year. Net interest income of $1.2 billion dollars increased 38 percent or $339 million dollars year over year, primarily driven by continued growth in the mortgage portfolio.\nNon-interest income was $2.9 billion dollars, up 38 percent year over year, primarily driven by higher revenues from held-for-sale loan purchase and securitization activities, and lower realized losses on sales of available-for-sale securities and other net investment gains.\nThe provision for credit losses for 2024 was an expense of $102 million dollars, down $198 million dollars from 2023. Provision for credit losses this year was driven by deterioration in overall loan performance and new loans purchases, which was partially offset by a credit reserve release due to enhancement of our credit loss estimation process. A credit reserve build due to increased uncertainty in forecasted economic and multifamily market conditions, as well as deterioration in overall loan performance, drove 2023 provision for credit loss expense of $300 million dollars.\nTotal new business activity for 2024 was $65 billion dollars, an increase of 35 percent compared to 2023, primarily driven by increased demand for multifamily financing as a result of lower mortgage interest rates during second half of the year. Approximately 65 percent of this activity in 2024, based on UPB, was mission-driven affordable housing, exceeding FHFA's minimum requirement of 50 percent.\nIn 2024 we securitized $55 billion dollars of loans, $2 billion higher than the $53 billion dollars in the prior year. Fully guaranteed securitizations made up 45 percent of the total issuances, up from 32 percent in 2023.\nThe average guarantee fee rate on our total guarantee exposures increased to 51 basis points at end of this year, up 5 basis points from the prior year primarily due to continued growth in our fully guaranteed securitization issuances, for which we charge higher rates.\nOur Multifamily mortgage portfolio at the end of 2024 was $467 billion dollars, an increase of 6 percent year over year.\nThe Multifamily delinquency rate at end of the year was 40 basis points, up from 28 basis points at end of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in delinquent floating rate loans, including small balance loans that are in their floating rate period. Ninety-seven percent of the delinquent loans in the Multifamily mortgage portfolio had credit enhancement coverage, reducing our credit exposure.\nSo, at year-end, 91 percent of the Multifamily mortgage portfolio was covered by credit enhancements.\nCapital\nOur net worth increased to $59.6 billion dollars at the end of the year representing a 25 percent increase from 2023.\nFinally, I want to take a moment to express our sympathy to everyone affected by the devastating California wildfires. Those impacted should know that Freddie Mac is here to help. We encourage them to contact their mortgage servicers to learn about the immediate relief options now available. These include Freddie Mac’s forbearance program, which offers mortgage relief for up to 12 months without incurring late fees or penalties. We also provide dedicatedresources to rentersin apartment buildings, to help them plan and prepare for natural disasters, as well as respond and recover after they strike. Providing this critical support to owners and renters not only benefits communities, investors and our company, it’s the right thing to do.\nIn conclusion, 2024 was another strong year for Freddie Mac as we made home possible for nearly 1.6 million families, provided billions in liquidity to the markets and built our financial strength.\nWe are already hard at work to ensure we continue making strides in these areas in 2025 and beyond.\n©2025 by Freddie Mac.\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nJim Whitlinger is executive vice president and chief financial officer.

The second estimate reflected increases in consumer spending, exports, federal government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment. As with the previous quarters, in Q3 2024, consumption spending led growth by contributing 2.4 percentage points to real GDP growth, compared to a contribution of 1.9 percentage points in Q2 2024.\nThe labor market rebounded from the lows of October as the impact of the hurricanes receded and the Boeing strike resolved. November saw payroll gains of 227,000 with October gains revised up from 12,000 to 36,000. Combined, September and October were revised up by 56,000. Employment growth is still consistent with a job market that is cooling from the highs seen over the last couple of years. The unemployment rate remains low at 4.2% in November 2024.\nU.S. inflation, which had been receding over the past few months, ticked up slightly in October. Core inflation as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) less food and energy rose 0.3% over the month in October and 2.8% from a year ago. Prices for goods decreased 0.1% over the month but were offset by a 0.4% increase in prices for services. Although showing a modest increase in the year over year rate, core PCE price inflation is still consistent with expectations of a gradual cooling of inflation as the long and variable lags of monetary policy work their way through the economy.\nEconomic growth for 2024 has remained strong and is on track to be above the long run trend growth estimate. The labor market, while cooling, continues to remain strong and inflation continues to slowly move towards the Fed target of 2% indicating that we remain on a path towards a soft landing.\nU.S. housing and mortgage market:Home sales remained subdued amid rising interest rates throughout October. Total (new + existing) home sales remained virtually unchanged in October. After reaching their lowest level since 2010 in September, existing home sales increased 3.4% over the month in October to 3.96 million. This increase in existing home sales was offset by new home sales, which fell sharply in October to an annual rate of 610,000, the lowest level since November 2022. Both hurricanes Helene and Milton had negative effects on home sales, with much of the decline occurring in the south. After ticking up slightly last month, the supply of existing homes decreased to 4.2 months in October. Homeowners are still not incentivized to sell, keeping supply below the 5 to 6 months’ supply indicative of a balanced housing market.\nHousing construction slowed in October. Total housing starts declined 3.1% from September and 4.0% from last October. This decrease was primarily due to a slowdown in multifamily construction, which decreased 12.6% from last October. Homebuilder confidence rose for the third consecutive month to an index of 46 in November, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ (NAHB) Housing Market Index. The increased confidence is mostly due to the Federal Reserve loosening monetary policy as builders benefit from interest rate cuts which help lower construction financing costs. Despite this increase, the index has remained below 50 since August 2023, indicating that building conditions are expected to remain weak in the near term. The NAHB Housing Market Index is a diffusion indexed constructed so that a value of 50 indicates sentiment is on balance neutral, while values above (below) 50 indicate that sentiment is on balance positive (negative).\nHouse price appreciation continued to slow from the highs witnessed in 2022. As measured by the FHFA House Price Index, U.S. house prices in September 2024 rose 0.7% month-over-month and 4.4% from last year. All nine census divisions showed annual increases.\nMortgage rates remained elevated throughout November, ending the month at 6.81%. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage as measured by Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey®averaged 6.81% in November. Mortgage rates have remained essentially flat throughout the last few weeks, keeping potential homeowners waiting for affordability to improve. Refinance activity accounted for about 38% of total application activity at the end of November, decreasing since September as mortgage rates continued to rise. While refinance activity decreased, there was a slight uptick in purchase activity as potential homebuyers reacted to the modest decrease in rates. Purchase applications were up 23.5% in the last week of November as compared to the last week in October.\nBefore we delve into the outlook for 2025, let’s look back at 2024 to see how the economy and housing markets evolved. Below are our top three trends of 2024.\nThe 2024 U.S. labor market, despite the uncertainty, demonstrated remarkable resilience. Job openings and hiring rates stabilized compared to the post-pandemic recovery. As of November 2024, 1.98 million jobs were added to the economy, equating to 165,000 jobs per month. Education and healthcare sectors added the most jobs followed by government, professional and business services and leisure and hospitality (Exhibit 1).\nThe unemployment rate hovered near the pre-pandemic level and currently sits at 4.2% averaging around 4% for the eleven months of the year so far. Despite economic challenges, there was a gain in average hourly earnings of around 3.9% to 4.3% in 2024. Overall, the labor market exhibited resilience, even in the face of economic shifts and inflationary pressures.\nEnlarge Image\nInterest rates have been very volatile over the year mainly due to the uncertainty around the Federal Reserve rate path and the elections (Exhibit 2). At the beginning of the year, higher-than-expected inflation and stronger economic growth led to a reevaluation of the Fed’s rate path and the Federal Reserve decided to hold the fed fund rates at the 5.25-5.5% range. But since May, with some cooling in the inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve signaled upcoming rate cuts, which materialized starting in September. Most of the declines in mortgage rates were already baked in by the first Fed rate cut in September. Since September, rates have been on the rise again, as we explained in ourNovember Outlook, and ended the month of November at 6.81% after hitting 2-year lows of 6.08% in late September.\nEnlarge Image\nIn 2024, housing affordability remained one of the most significant issues facing American households. High mortgage rates and home prices significantly contributed to declining affordability. Growing homeowners’ insurance costs further challenged housing affordability. According to our latest calculations, as of August 2024, an average borrower paid an annual homeowners’ insurance premium of $1,761, 13.6% higher than in 2023 and 61.8% higher than in 2018, with substantial variation across different states. As homeowners’ insurance costs continue to rise, borrowers face an increased financial burden. From 2018 to 2024 (as of August), the average borrower’s share of income spent on homeowners’ insurance premiums has increased from 1.5% to 1.7%. The burden of these costs is not evenly distributed. Some homeowners, especially those with lower incomes, are affected more by the increased cost of homeowners’ insurance than moderate- and high-income borrowers. Between 2018 and 2024, very low-income borrowers (those with an income no greater than 50% of the area median income) were consistently most burdened by such costs. As of August 2024, low-income borrowers spent 3.4% of their monthly income on homeowners’ insurance premiums. The impact of high interest rates and home prices affecting the principal and interest payments is much larger than the net impact of insurance cost, but it is still a significant burden on marginal borrowers trying to get into the housing market as well as homeowners with fixed incomes.\nEnlarge Image\nWith this background, for 2025, we expect the economy to continue its growth, although at a slightly slower pace than in 2024. While there is still a considerable amount of policy uncertainty, under our baseline scenario, we expect inflation to continue to move towards the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2% and a gradual cooling of the labor market from its recent levels. We also expect the Federal Reserve to continue on its implied rate cut path over the course of the next year.\nWe expect mortgage rates to decline over 2025, but very gradually. Declining rates will boost home sales to a slightly higher level than what we saw in 2024. Interest rate lock-in remains a major challenge for the housing market. Our estimate of the average interest rate lock-in effect for conventional mortgage borrowers was up from $42,000 in October to $47,800 in November 2024. House price growth may continue to moderate given increased supply and declining but still high mortgage rates. This modest growth in house prices, and the increase in home sales should support the purchase market in 2025. We also expect refinance volumes to increase mainly based on declining mortgage rates. We forecast total origination volumes to increase in 2025.\nHousing expenses are the largest component of a household’s budget and account for around a third of total monthly expenses for the average American household. The rising demand for housing along with the shortage of homes available have pushed up both house prices and rents. We explored buying vs. renting in arecently published research notewhere we found that poor affordability has widened the gap between the typical payments and rents on the same house. While affordability of owning relative to renting is very poor compared to pre-pandemic levels, it is similar to the early 2000s and within the upper range of historical norms. In this spotlight, we focus on how housing expenditures have shifted in recent years in an era of rising housing costs.\nAccording to the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) by Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), as of 2023 a typical consumer spent around $77,000 per annum with the largest share of expenditure going towards housing followed by transportation and food.2Renters allocate a larger share of their expenses towards rent at 39% compared to homeowners who spend 31% on their total housing expenses. Housing expenses include shelter expenses (mortgage payments, taxes and insurance), utilities, fuel and services, household operations, housekeeping supplies and household furnishings, and equipment. While in nominal terms the total expenses increased by 252% over the period between 1984 and 2023, after accounting for inflation, expenses in real terms increased by 20%. In this spotlight, we study the share of expenses homeowners and renters spend on various expenditure categories to account for increases in both incomes and price levels over the period from 1984 to 2023.\nEnlarge Image\nPer the 2023 CEX, on average a homeowner’s expense on shelter as a share of total expenditures has been around 15% since 1984. The shelter portion of housing expenses includes maintenance, property taxes, and mortgage and interest charges.Exhibit 5(on the following page) plots the shelter expense for homeowners. As can be seen from the exhibit, the share of homeowner expenses on shelter rose and eventually peaked at 17% right before the financial crisis and has come down since then. There was another uptick during the pandemic, but since then it has stabilized back to its previous levels. Within shelter, mortgage and interest charges account for around 8% of total homeowner expenditures on average since 1984, peaking in 2006. As of 2023, mortgage interest and charges contributed to 6% of the total housing expense. While mortgages rates and house prices have increased now, a vast majority of the homeowners are locked into very low rates, helping homeowners keep their monthly payments lower as compared to the other expenses. Additionally, about two out of five homeowner households own their home free and clear without a mortgage, so their expenses on shelter are limited to insurance, taxes and maintenance.\nProperty taxes as well as maintenance and repairs have steadily increased over the years. Property taxes contributed to 3% of the total housing expense in 1984 and increased to 5% by 2009, remaining at that level since. Maintenance, repairs and other expenses also steadily rose over the years and doubled by 2023. In terms of the other broad categories BLS collects data for, we find that expenses on utilities and fuel declined between 1984 and 2023, along with household furnishings. On the other hand, expenses on household operations increased slightly while expenses on housekeeping supplies have remained constant.\nEnlarge Image\nIf we look at mortgage versus the non-mortgage expenses, we find that non-mortgage expenses have gone up more than the mortgage expenses. Non-mortgage expense is the total housing expense (which includes expenses on shelter, utilities, household supplies, household operations, etc.) less the expenses on mortgage interest and charges (Exhibit 6). Even though mortgage expenses increased from $1,982 in 1984 to $5,263 in 2023, the share of mortgage expense to total housing expenditures declined from 26% to 19% over the same period, mainly due to the fixed rate mortgages. On the other hand, non-mortgage expenses increased from $5,751 to $21,942 but their share also increased from 74% to 81% of total house expenditure share over the same period. So, while overall expenses on housing have increased over the period, how have homeowners adjusted and how have their expenses shifted over the years?\nEnlarge Image\nThe components of homeowner expenditures that saw declining expenditure shares are food, apparel and transportation.Exhibit 7plots the homeowner expenses excluding housing. Apparel saw the largest decline as a share of total expenditures, from 6% in 1984 to just 2% in 2023.\nEnlarge Image\nUnlike homeowners, who mostly have a fixed-rate mortgage and are shielded from rising interest rates and house prices, renters do not have the same advantage and must deal with rising rent costs. For renters, the share of average annual expenditures spent on rent rose from 18% to 26% between 1984 to 2023 (Exhibit 8). As opposed to homeowners, this steady increase in rent expenditure means that renters are having to cut back on their spending elsewhere.\nThese cuts are likely to be seen in more discretionary categories rather than necessities. As outlined in Engels Law, it is likely that the percentage of average annual expenditure for food at home will stay relatively constant regardless of how much the share of shelter expenditures increase.3As can be seen in Exhibit 8, expenditures on food declined only slightly during the period from 1984-2023.\nEnlarge Image\nIf we break down food into food away from home and food at home, we find that food away from home has increased slightly from its low in 2020 but has not made the recovery back to its pre-pandemic levels. Aside from food, a downward trend is also observed with renters’ expenditures on apparel and services.\nAnother area where renters have cut back expenses is transportation. Expenditure shares for transportation have declined more for renters than homeowners. One possible explanation for this could behomeowners moving awayfrom city centers to suburbs to buy a home, therefore spending more on transportation in order to commute to work. Renters, however, are more likely to live closer to work and can spend less on transportation as a percentage of their total expenses.\nUnlike homeowners, for renters, the share of rent in total housing expenses has been rising as compared to the non-rent expense (Exhibit 9). Non-rental housing expenses like the non-mortgage expense includes utilities, household operations, furnishings, housekeeping supplies, etc.\nEnlarge Image\nTo conclude, homeowners were able to lock themselves into lower mortgage rates and shield themselves from the rising interest rates and house prices. However, renters do not have the same advantage and must deal with rising rent costs. These rising costs meant reducing spending on other categories of expenses such as apparel and food away from home. While overall transportation expenses declined, they declined more for renters who typically try to rent closer to work, while homeowners have seen a movement away from city centers to the suburbs indicating a large share of transportation expenses as compared to renters.\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\nSam Khater, Chief EconomistLen Kiefer, Deputy Chief EconomistAjita Atreya, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerRama Yanamandra, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerPenka Trentcheva, Macro & Housing Economics SeniorGenaro Villa, Macro & Housing Economics SeniorCaroline Cheatham, Finance Analyst\nwww.freddiemac.com/research\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

The Conservator has delegated to the Board and its committees authority to function in accordance with the duties and authorities set forth in applicable statutes, regulations, guidance, orders and directives and our Bylaws and Board committee charters, but reserved certain items that would require Conservator approval. On November 15, 2012, the Conservator revised and expanded the categories of items requiring Conservator approval, instructing the Board that it should oversee that management consults with and obtains approval of the Conservator before taking action in the following areas:\nFHFA has indicated that it expects the Board to review and approve all matters that will require Conservator approval before such matters are submitted to FHFA. In addition, FHFA is requiring timely notice of any planned changes in business processes or operations, including changes to single-family or multifamily credit policies and loss mitigation strategies that management has determined in its reasonable business judgment to be significant, other than changes made at the direction or request of FHFA. FHFA will then determine whether any such actions or plans require Conservator and/or Board review or approval.\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nMedia Room\nInvestor Relations\nCareers\nOur Suppliers\nOur Business\nSingle-Family Division\nMultifamily Division\nCapital Markets Division\nResources\nMortgage Lookup Tool\nRental Lookup Tool\nMy Home by Freddie Mac®\nCreditSmart®\nConnect With Us\nContact Us\nReport a Security or Privacy Incident\nSign up for news, tips, and insights"

Freddie Mac’s Codes of Conduct set critical expectations for our behavior, with separate versions that apply to employees and Directors. Freddie Mac is required to review its Codes of Conduct at least once every three years. Most recently, the Board of Directors approved the revision to the Board Code of Conduct on September 7, 2023 (including only formatting updates). On January 1, 2023, the Employee Code of Conduct was revised to highlight additional areas of focus (including Fair Lending and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) for the company and to generally refresh the document. On January 1, 2025, updates were made to the Employee Code of Conduct to clarify conflicts of interest and information risk expectations and included a leadership message from our new CEO.\nFreddie Mac's complaint policy for accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters pertaining to the company's business has been created in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. The policy establishes processes, and defines responsibilities for the receipt, retention and prompt resolution of complaints, including the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.\nCertain employees are required to abide with six-month cooling-off periods following their termination of their employment with Freddie Mac. The cooling-off periods restrict specific types of engagement with Freddie Mac on behalf of the former employees' new employers. Knowing violations of the cooling-off periods may result in legal action. Third Parties may direct any questions about these restrictions to theCompliance & Ethics Helpline.\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nMedia Room\nInvestor Relations\nCareers\nOur Suppliers\nOur Business\nSingle-Family Division\nMultifamily Division\nCapital Markets Division\nResources\nMortgage Lookup Tool\nRental Lookup Tool\nMy Home by Freddie Mac®\nCreditSmart®\nConnect With Us\nContact Us\nReport a Security or Privacy Incident\nSign up for news, tips, and insights"

One important example of this work is how we’ve tackled loan repurchases.\nThe volume of loan defects identified on incoming loans we purchase, also known as Non-Acceptable Quality (NAQ) rates, reached a high point in the third quarter of 2022 as the result of significant refinance volume during the pandemic. Consequently, repurchase requests on those loans peaked in first quarter of 2023.\nWe began an open dialog with our lenders and other industry participants, enhancing our communication and collaboration. We also piloted a fee-based repurchase alternative to a limited number of lenders. While those efforts proved effective, we continued to look for additional improvements to our quality control (QC) processes. As a result, we recently announced three major changes to the way we do business with lenders. These include:\nBefore providing greater detail about each of these items, it’s worth sharing our progress thus far.\nSince starting the effort to address the problem, performing loan repurchase requests declined materially. In fact, NAQ rates on incoming loans to the company are approximately 28% lower than their peak in the third quarter of 2022. As a result, repurchase requests are trending down to approximately 55% lower than their peak in the first quarter of 2023. For vitally important small and community lenders, repurchase requests are even lower, down 80%.\nAlthough this performance is encouraging, we’re not done. Here’s what we are doing to improve on our progress thus far.\nCurrently, loan repurchase is the primary remedy for all loans with significant defects identified during QC reviews, regardless of performance status. By both expanding our existing repurchase alternative pilot and introducing a new fee-only remedy for those who choose not to opt into the expanded pilot, we aim to reconsider the decades-old single loan repurchase remedy approach.\nExpanding our repurchase alternative: The expanded pilot uses a fee-based structure that is more efficient and transparent and rewards lenders that deliver high-quality loans. Specifically:\nNew fee-only option with immediate R&W relief: For lenders who choose to continue participating in Freddie Mac’s traditional performing loan remediesframework, the company will now offer a new fee-only option. With this fee-only remedy, lenders can obtain immediate R&W relief in lieu of repurchasing a defective loan. This remedy is for eligible loans delivered to us in the first quarter of 2025.\nEnhanced transparency and reporting: Beginning next year, we will publish a new quarterly report that will provide greater transparency on loan repurchase activity. Through this offering, lenders will be better able to assess their own proprietary data against broader industry manufacturing quality.\nThough we expect lenders to continue doing their part to improve loan quality, we will take additional steps to improve our quality control review process to ensure outcomes are consistent, reasons for defects are well-defined, and feedback to lenders is clear. We remain committed to listening to feedback from lenders and industry partners as our business and economic conditions evolve and look forward to building a stronger housing industry that supports sustainable homeownership opportunities.\n©2025 by Freddie Mac.\nExecutive Vice President and Head of the Single-Family Acquisitions Division\nSonu Mittal is the executive vice president and head of the Freddie Mac Single-Family Acquisitions Division.

The UMBS market, created in collaboration between Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, borrowed from established market standards but relied on the Enterprises’ expertise to create a single mortgage-backed security that resulted in a more competitive environment and greater market liquidity for investors.\nThe concept of a unified mortgage securities market was proposed to increase competitiveness and liquidity in the to-be-announced (TBA) market, where Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities trade. The ultimate goal was to maintain or lower the cost of housing finance, which has potential benefits for homebuyers.\nBut there was work to be done to turn the concept into a reality.\nA single, unified market would not be possible if the securities issued by the Enterprises were valued differently by market participants. To solve for this, we worked to ensure the performance of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities were comparable. This involved two core efforts:\nThe final hurdle was the maintenance of alignment of UMBS prepayment rates over time. In February 2019, FHFA issued the Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities Rule to regulate the alignment of prepayment rates through established thresholds and required monitoring and reporting of any misalignment.\nThis rule, as well as additional regulatory requirements implemented since 2019, have helped address market concerns and allowed market participants to accept the UMBS construct.\nSince we introduced the UMBS five years ago, its benefits both to Freddie Mac and the market have been clear. Specifically, markets and investors have benefitted from greater liquidity and less uncertainty around prepayments — factors that have remained aligned regardless of greater economic challenges.\nMoreover, this initiative has reduced splintering of the TBA market that was occurring previously. Investors are now less likely to put stipulations, or restrictions, on trades than before UMBS, indicating they do not differentiate between the Enterprises’ UMBS. The reduction in stipulated trading also amplifies the liquidity benefit of the UMBS market.\nThe UMBS also has eliminated the price differential that previously existed between the securities issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\nWhat’s more, UMBS performance benefits have been achieved without any disruptions to the market. This could be clearly seen during the refinance wave of 2020 and early 2021, which featured some of the highest levels of sustained prepayment rates ever recorded. Despite this, the divergence between prepayment rates at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae was much more muted than in previous refinance waves. This result is attributed to work done in support of the UMBS.\nThose who are buying a home or refinancing their mortgage benefit from UMBS as well. Overall, the UMBS has increased the liquidity of the Enterprises’ most widely traded security. Greater liquidity lowers the price investors demand when they purchase the security, which potentially helps keep interest rates lower on the home purchase and refinance loans that back those securities.\nAs we look ahead, we remain committed to our alignment on UMBS, which is key to the success of the market. But we also expect to innovate, looking for new ways to better serve borrowers, lenders and investors.\nIn doing so, we will consider potential impacts to the UMBS market because, if the past five years are any indication, the market has become important mechanism for helping Freddie Mac provide liquidity to the U.S. housing market.\n©2025 by Freddie Mac.\nFreddie Mac Vice President, Single-Family Securitization\nBarbara Pak is the vice president of Freddie Mac’s Single-Family Securitization department.

Box 43078Providence, RI 02940-3078United States of America\nWebsite:https://www-us.computershare.com/investor\nUnder Freddie Mac's Congressional charter, the corporation's official name is Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. However, the Board of Directors has authorized the corporation to conduct business as Freddie Mac.\nFreddie Mac is a federally chartered corporation created by Congress on July 24, 1970.\nThe company's corporate headquarters is located in McLean, VA. Freddie Mac also operates five regional offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York.\nOn January 3, 1989, Freddie Mac stock was converted into a class of stock that could be owned and traded by all investors. (Prior to that date, ownership of the stock was limited by its terms to financial institutions and a small number of other parties.) On August 9, 1989, Congress amended Freddie Mac's charter to convert this class of stock into Voting Common Stock, granting its holders the right to elect 13 directors of the Company. The Voting Common Stock and its predecessors were listed on the New York Stock Exchange from 1984 through July 7, 2010, and began trading exclusively on the over-the-counter (OTC) market since July 8, 2010.\nBeginning on July 8, 2010, Freddie Mac common stock is exclusively traded on the OTC market.\nThe ticker symbol is FMCC.\nNo. Freddie Mac was chartered by Congress as a private company serving a public purpose. On September 6, 2008, the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), appointed FHFA as conservator of Freddie Mac. As conservator, FHFA has all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of Freddie Mac, and of any stockholder, officer, or director of Freddie Mac with respect to Freddie Mac and its assets; and title to the books, records and assets of Freddie Mac. In connection with the appointment of FHFA as conservator, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have entered into a Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement. As part of the agreement, Freddie Mac has issued senior preferred stock to Treasury, together with a warrant for the purchase of common stock representing 79.9% of Freddie Mac’s common stock.\nFreddie Mac ’s regulator is theFederal Housing Finance Agency(FHFA).  FHFA was established in 2008 as an independent government agency responsible for oversight of the operations of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Banks. In addition, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has fair housing authority over Freddie Mac.\nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae have substantially similar charters, Congressional mandates, and regulatory structures. Both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are publicly traded corporations. Ginnie Mae is a government-owned corporation within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that guarantees mortgage-backed securities backed by federally insured or guaranteed loans. Unlike Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae does not purchase mortgages from lenders, nor does it buy, sell, or issue securities.\nWe conduct business through two business segments, the single-family business segment and the multifamily business segment. Those two segments are primarily supported by our Single-Family Division, Multifamily Division, and Capital Markets Division.\nSingle-Family Business Segment\nOur single-family business segment supports responsible, sustainable homeownership. We do so primarily through the work of our Single- Family Division and Capital Markets Division.Those divisions work with lenders of all sizes – national, regional and community lenders and credit unions – to buy conventional, conforming mortgage loans for one- to four-unit homes – including condominiums and manufactured homes – up to a certain dollar amount set by our regulator. As part of our mission, we are committed to creating homeownership opportunities for people hoping to buy a home for the first time, earning low and moderate incomes and living in underserved markets.\nBecause lenders know they can sell loans to us, they are more willing to make long-term, fixed-rate loans, which make mortgage payments more affordable to more households. When a homeowner faces financial difficulties, we work with the lender to help the borrower avoid foreclosure, where possible, or exit homeownership as smoothly as possible.We also promote liquidity and make funding more available to borrowers by purchasing mortgage-related securities guaranteed by Freddie Mac and other financial institutions as investments. We fund these investments by issuing corporate debt securities. Freddie Mac's investors include, but are not limited to, central and commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies and securities dealers from around the world.\nMultifamily Business Segment\nOur multifamily business segment supports affordable rental opportunities across the nation, primarily through the work of our Multifamily Division and capital markets activities within that group and the Capital Markets Division.\nWorking with a network of specialized lenders, Freddie Mac provides funding for loans on properties ranging from five units to hundreds of units across multiple buildings. We support all types of multifamily properties nationwide, including conventional, seniors, student and subsidized housing as well as smaller properties and manufactured housing communities.\nOur funding is vital to making sure that renters have access to adequate, affordable apartment homes. Around 90 percent of the apartments we finance each year are affordable to low- or moderate-income renters. Multifamily borrowers mainly are commercial entities, such as property developers, and the properties are considered businesses. Our in-house teams closely oversee loan and property quality throughout the life of each loan.\nOn July 18, 2008, Freddie Mac registered its common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Freddie Mac files its period financial disclosure documents with the SEC via the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.\nPrior to Freddie Mac's voluntary registration of its common stock with the SEC on July 18, 2008, Freddie Mac did not file financial reports with the SEC and instead prepared Annual Information Statements and Quarterly Information Statement Supplements in lieu of Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, which are available from the company's Investor Relations Department.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) has been our auditor since March 6, 2002.\nAs announced by FHFA Director, James Lockhart, on September 7, 2008, all future common and preferred stock dividends would be eliminated, other than dividends on the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nFreddie Mac has had two common stock splits. The Board of Directors authorized a 3-for-1 stock split effective April 9, 1992 and a 4-for-1 stock split effective January 13, 1997.\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nMedia Room\nInvestor Relations\nCareers\nOur Suppliers\nOur Business\nSingle-Family Division\nMultifamily Division\nCapital Markets Division\nResources\nMortgage Lookup Tool\nRental Lookup Tool\nMy Home by Freddie Mac®\nCreditSmart®\nConnect With Us\nContact Us\nReport a Security or Privacy Incident\nSign up for news, tips, and insights"

We work with the Federal Housing Finance Agency to ensure all pilots are consistent with our charter and follow established governance processes.\nThe information below is designed to increase transparency around Freddie Mac’s active pilots and test-and-learns, in addition to those that were recently designated inactive.\nIn a housing market marked by high mortgage rates and low housing supply, second mortgages can offer substantial benefits for borrowers, lenders and the overall market — often at a lower risk than some alternatives such as a cash-out refinance. Freddie Mac is engaging in a limited pilot to purchase certain single-family closed-end second mortgages as part of a conditional approval by FHFA, which includes the following terms:\nUpon the pilot’s conclusion, FHFA will analyze the data on Freddie Mac’s purchases of second mortgages to determine whether the objectives of the pilot were met and next steps.\nPilot Scope:Limited rollout started in December 2024.Plan Alignment:N/APilot Status:Active\nTo work with Sellers on improving the quality of performing loans, the company will pilot a replacement to its current repurchase policy for defective performing loans. The pilot will use a fee-based structure that is more efficient, transparent and rewards lenders that deliver high-quality loans. Specifically, lenders will not be subject to repurchases on most performing loans and will instead be subject to a fee-based structure based on non-acceptable quality (NAQ) rates. The fee will apply uniformly to medium and large lenders based on NAQ rates and will be waived for smaller lenders that do not deliver a large enough volume to generate a statistically significant NAQ rate. Loans that are non-performing within 36 months or subject to life of loan defects will still be subject to repurchase. This fee structure will begin with a limited rollout with targeted lenders in early 2024.Pilot Scope:Limited rollout starting in early 2024.Plan Alignment:N/APilot Status:Active\nOur efforts focus on assessing enhancements for new and existing collateral valuation methods. The overarching objectives are to promote more consistent outcomes and maintain appropriate levels of risk management to mitigate the loss associated with default, while creating efficiencies that may save time and lower costs in the appraisal process.Pilot Scope:Limited to target set of lenders, ensuring participation of small and medium size lenders. Pilot is ongoing in 2025.Plan Alignment:N/APilot Status:Active\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused hardships for millions of homeowners, many of who took advantage of forbearance. However, due to long-term or permanent changes in household composition and earnings, we expect some homeowners may require payment relief beyond existing offerings to stay in their homes when their forbearance expires.

As with the previous quarters, in Q3 2024, consumption spending led the growth and at 3.7%, grew at the fastest pace since Q1 2023. Consumption spending has remained resilient even in the face of high inflation and a still-high interest rate environment. The contribution of this component to overall growth was around 2.5 percentage points. Compared to Q2 2024, the decrease in Q3 GDP growth was primarily due to a downturn in private inventory investment and a significant deceleration in residential fixed investment. This was partially offset by increases in exports, consumer spending, and federal government spending.\nThe labor market continued to moderate. Per the latest employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), payroll growth for October witnessed a sharp decline, with the economy adding only 12,000 jobs. However, this slowdown was mainly attributed to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which hit the Southeastern part of the country, and a strike at Boeing that subtracted around 44,000 jobs from the manufacturing sector. Despite facing temporary disruptions in job growth, the unemployment rate stayed consistent at 4.1% for the second month. Average hourly wage growth also remained at 4% on a year-over-year basis. While the payroll gains for October came in at the lowest level since December 2020, these declines led by temporary events are not a major cause for concern.\nAs measured by the Employment Cost Index, compensation costs for civilian workers, increased 3.9% in Q3 2024. This is a decrease from the second quarters’ increase of 4.1% and is the lowest since late 2021. This decrease further shows wage growth moderating amid a softening labor market.\nInflationary pressures have been receding over the past few months, but remain above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.2% over the month in August and 2.7% from a year ago. Prices for goods have been leading the slowdown in overall inflation with a 0.1% monthly decline and a 1.2% yearly decline in September. Conversely, prices for services continue to rise and were up 0.3% month-over-month and rose 3.7% from a year ago.\nEconomic growth for Q3 2024 remained strong and above the long run trend growth estimate. With the labor market continuing to moderate and inflation cooling towards the Fed target of 2%, and the Federal Reserve might continue on its implied rate cut path.\nU.S. housing and mortgage market:Home sales remained subdued despite mortgage rates declining and hitting 2-year lows in September. Total (new + existing) home sales fell 0.2% in September as homebuyers wait for rates to decrease. Existing home sales continued their downward trend with sales in September at the lowest level since October 2010 at 3.84 million. Existing sales continue to reel under the pressure of high mortgage rates and the rate lock-in effect. New home sales rose slightly to 738,000 in September, with the pace of new home sales continuing to run above the pre-pandemic average. In the face of increasing mortgage rates, more builders are using sales incentives and therefore making new homes more attractive for potential buyers. Slower sales have led to a slight pick-up in inventory, with the supply of existing homes at 4.3 months in September, the highest since October 2020. However, despite the recent increase, months’ supply remains low by historical standards and is below the 5 to 6 months’ supply that is typically considered consistent with a balanced housing market.\nHousing construction also decelerated in September. Total housing starts declined 0.5% from August and 0.7% from last September. This decrease was primarily due to a slowdown in multifamily construction, which decreased over 15% from last September. Homebuilder confidence inched up for the second consecutive month to 43, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ Housing Market Index. Though increasing for the second time in six months, the index has remained below 50 since August 2023, indicating that building conditions are expected to remain poor in the near term.2\nHouse price appreciation continued to slow from the highs witnessed in 2022. As measured by the FHFA House Price Index, U.S. house prices in August 2024 rose 0.3% month over month and 4.2% from last year. All nine census divisions showed annual increases, ranging from 2.4% in the West South Central division to 6.3% in the East North Central division.\nHigher mortgage rates and low affordability impacted the homeownership rate in Q3 2024. The homeownership rate was slightly lower at 65.6% in Q3 2024 compared to 66% in Q3 2023, per the Residential Vacancies and Homeownership Report by the U.S. Census Bureau. Between Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, the total number of housing units rose from 145.4 million to 147.0 million, an increase of around 1.5 million units. Occupied units increased by 1.7 million, while vacant units fell by 0.2 million. Most notably, the increase in occupied housing units was primarily driven by renter-occupied units which increased by 1.1 million units from 44.3 million in Q3 2023 to 45.5 million in Q3 2024. However, owner-occupied units increased only 0.6 million units from 86.0 million to 86.6 million. The homeowner vacancy rate ticked slightly up from 0.9% in Q2 2024 to 1.0% in Q3 2024 and was up from 0.8% in Q3 2023. The renter vacancy rate at 6.9% in Q3 2024 increased from 6.6% in Q2 2024 and from the 6.6% a year ago. The increase in rental vacancy reflects a large backlog of recently completed multifamily construction projects, boosting the number of units available.\nMortgage rates rose from their two-year low, seen in September at 6.08% and reached 6.72% as of the last week of October. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage as measured by Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey®averaged 6.43% in October. While homebuyers are waiting on the sidelines for mortgage rates to go down, especially after the 50-basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, most of the declines in rates were already baked in by the first Fed rate cut.\nExhibit 1outlines the change in mortgage rates in the 12 weeks prior and the 12 weeks after the first Fed rate cut in seven episodes since the 1990s. As can be seen from the chart, rates begin declining in anticipation of the Fed rate cut but after the cut, rates remain stable and decline only very gradually. While the Fed usually cuts rates during times of economic distress, this time is different. The U.S. economy remains in a position of strength. Since the first Fed rate cut in September, mortgage interest rates are up nearly ¾ of a percentage point, which is more than average and speaks to the unique circumstances in the economy today.\nRising rates are unwelcome news to potential homebuyers who might have been hoping that Fed rate cuts would result in lower mortgage rates. However, if we look back historically at past rate cutting cycles, we see that interest rates typically do not fall much following a rate cut. If we look at the previous 6 rate cutting cycles, 6 weeks after the initial Fed rate cut mortgage ratesincreasedon average 0.1 percentage points. This is because mortgage rates are influenced by the long-term rates, which already priced in the Fed rate cut. With economic growth surprising on the upside, bond market participants are starting to consider a slower pace of future rate cuts and factor in the potential for higher-than-expected inflation in the near-term. This has resulted in upward pressure on long-term rates, including mortgage rates.\nEnlarge Image\nRecent volatility in rates has weighed on housing and mortgage activity. Existing home sales have fallen to 14-year lows. Refinance activity, which witnessed a boomlet in September, is also receding as rates are on the rise again.\nOur outlook has not been adjusted to reflect any impact of the U.S. election. As such, we have not factored in any potential changes to the U.S. fiscal outlook or other policy.\nWhile the U.S. economy continues to surprise on the upside, we expect a moderation in economic growth in 2025. This is due to a further cooling of the labor market and a potential decrease in consumer spending. Under our baseline scenario, we expect inflation to continue to move towards the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%. As a result, we expect the Federal Reserve to implement further rate cuts in the upcoming meetings.\nMortgage rates rebounded rapidly from the 2-year lows in October and are back up above 6.7%. In the near- term, rates may continue to be volatile and higher rates will keep home sales muted for the remainder of this year. But as we get into 2025, we anticipate that rates will gradually decline throughout the year. The expected decline in mortgage rates in 2025 should loosen some of the rate lock-in effect for existing homeowners, offering more inventory in the market. The rate lock-in effect for October increased again as mortgage rates increased — up from $38,000 in September to $42,000 as of October 2024. Lower rates and the boost to inventory should lead to slightly higher home sales in 2025. We expect house prices to continue to grow, although at a slower pace.\nIn the mortgage market, as of Q2 2024, total purchase volumes were $336 billion while refinance volumes were $93 billion for a total volume of $429 billion. For 2025, we expect the decline in rates to boost refinance origination volumes. This, coupled with expected increase in purchase originations due to a modest growth in home sales and home prices, should improve the mortgage market in 2025. We forecast total origination volumes to increase modetly in 2025.\nHousing affordability remains one of the top economic issues facing American households. Both homeowners and renters have seen the cost of housing increase faster than other consumer prices, putting a significant strain on household budgets. As we have documented in several previous research notes,3the root cause of decreased housing affordability is the fact that housing supply has not increased enough to match demand. Inadequate housing supply leads homeowners and renters to bid up the sale price and rent of available housing, which puts a squeeze on affordability.\nIn this spotlight we provide an updated estimate of the housing supply shortage relative to long-run housing demand. In our last published estimate from May of 2021, we estimated that the U.S. housing shortage was 3.8 million units as of Q4 2020. Our updated estimate based on data through Q3 2024 is that the U.S. housing shortage has declined slightly to 3.7 million units.\nExhibit 2below breaks down how we arrived at the new estimate and compares it to prior estimates. Since our previous estimate for Q4 2020, the U.S. housing stock has increased by 5.8 million units, or an average annual rate of 2.1 million units per year. However, over that same time the number of households increased by 6.3 million (2.3 million annual rate), while target or latent households increased by 6.9 million (2.5 million annual rate). But despite the increases in housing stock and the much larger increase in household formation, our estimate of housing shortage is slightly lower than our previous estimate.\nThat’s due to our lower target vacancy rate assumption. Our previous analysis assumed a target vacancy rate of 13% which was the average vacancy rate during the period between Q1 1990 and Q2 2018. The target vacancy rate assumed units held off market would continue to remain high as was the trend at that time. However, since our last estimate, housing market conditions have changed, and the units held off market have been declining, especially since 2022. Therefore, we revised our target vacancy rate assumption to correspond to the stable period in the housing market which we consider was from Q1 1994 - Q4 2003. Thus, our target vacancy rate declined from 13% to 11.7%, reducing the number of vacant housing units needed by 1.3 million.\nEnlarge Image\nThe first component in estimating the housing shortage is housing demand. While we can directly observe the actual number of households in any given period, we cannot see households that have not formed due to high housing costs. To estimate the target number of households, we employ a counterfactual analysis. This method allows us to project the number of households that would have formed if housing cost had remained at the level in our benchmark period, which is the year 2000.\nWhile household formation increased during the pandemic, limited supply has meant that many potential homebuyers have been priced out due to affordability concerns. To estimate the latent demand, we consider the households that could have been formed were the housing costs more favorable. For our estimate of housing costs, we utilize rent data.4From 2000 to 2024 inflation-adjusted rents increased by 11%, from $1,396 per month to $1,556 per month. In our counterfactual, we set real rents back at 2000 levels and estimate the number of additional households that would create.\nWe obtain the current headship rates by 5-year population groups starting from 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, etc., from the Current Population Survey–Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC) using the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) (Flood et al. 2017).5We then adjust the current headship rate by the housing cost factor to obtain the target headship rate. To obtain the housing cost factor, we run an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition on the factors affecting household formation (including income and education, housing costs, race and age, marriage and children, etc.). We use rents as a proxy for housing costs as rents directly impact household formation. Based on the contribution of these factors, we add back the factors related to housing costs to the current headship rate to get the target headship rate which can be written as:\nWhereis the headship rate by 5-year age groups andis the contribution of housing costs to the total headship rate.\nApplying the new headship rates to the 2024 population by these 5-year age groups, we get the target households for each of the age group. If housing costs as measured by rents were more affordable, we estimate that the U.S. would have added 1 million more households with most of the growth coming from younger households.\nThe second component in the estimation of the housing shortage is vacant units. A well-functioning housing market requires some vacant properties. If there are too few vacant housing units, home sales and new rentals will be hard to fill as there will be limited options that are move-in ready. In addition, there are some homes that are either seasonally vacant or held off market. Overall vacancy rate was at 10.1% in Q3 2024, 1.6 percentage points below our target vacancy rate of 11.7%, which is derived as described below.\nFor the estimation of the housing supply shortage, we need a target vacancy rate. As explained above, we assume the vacancy rate during the “stable period” in the housing market (Q1 1994 – Q4 2003), 11.7%, to be the target vacancy rate.6Within this vacancy, we assume that the seasonally vacant units average 2.8% of the housing stock, 0.7% are assumed to be in the process of being rented or sold, 3.6% for rent or sale, and 4.5% held off market.Exhibit 3, on the following page, converts the target vacancy rate to the target number of vacant units needed by type of vacancy. The various components equal 2.7 million additional vacant housing units needed to balance the market given the demand estimates presented in the previous section.\nEnlarge Image\nOur updated estimates show that the housing market is still dramatically undersupplied relative to long-run housing demand. Despite adding 5.8 million housing units over approximately four years (since our previous estimate), housing demand has increased by almost the same amount, resulting in very little progress in reducing the housing shortage. In the aggregate, we estimate that U.S. housing stock is 3.7 million units below what is needed given our current population and assuming inflation-adjusted housing costs returned to historical levels. Even without the push from latent housing demand, the current housing stock remains below levels consistent with historical vacancy rates.\nWhile there is reason to be optimistic about the housing market given the demographic tailwind and the cohort of Millennials and young adults entering the housing market, high mortgage rates have put a damper on affordability. Rising home prices have also had an effect and are directly related to the supply shortage. Building more houses is essential but builders are also contending with high interest rates.\nThere is no silver bullet to alleviating this ongoing shortage. That said, there are viable options being considered and acted, upon including accessory dwelling units (ADUs), Community Land Trusts, condominium conversions, manufactured homes, to name a few. We will continue to study this topic and work with the industry to uncover potential solutions.\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\nSam Khater, Chief EconomistLen Kiefer, Deputy Chief EconomistAjita Atreya, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerRama Yanamandra, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerPenka Trentcheva, Macro & Housing Economics SeniorGenaro Villa, Macro & Housing Economics SeniorCaroline Cheatham, Finance Analyst\nwww.freddiemac.com/research\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

In this analysis, we use actual, detailed transaction data on rents, home prices, and mortgage payments for individual homes and borrowers to produce a new relative affordability measure. This methodology allows us to control for changes in the heterogeneity of homes and borrowers. It provides a much more granular and apples-to-apples view that also allows us to track the shift in potential homebuyer’s search behavior as the relative affordability of renting vs. owning shifted over time.\nBoth our mortgage vs. rent comparisons and our way of measuring move-ups are innovative and offer insights not published elsewhere.1We found that mortgage payments compared to rents on the same homes are very elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, but similar to the early 2000s and within the upper range of historical norms.\nOur new relative affordability research has three conclusions:\nWhile some risk indicators, such as the ratio of home prices to incomes, have raised concerns that home prices may have become disconnected from fundamentals, we are less concerned after accounting for high rents. We believe a significant housing shortage combined with an increased demand for space to accommodate home offices is impacting affordability for both the single-family rental and purchase markets. If this assessment is correct, home prices and rents are likely to remain elevated, underscoring the importance of increasing new construction.\nThis article focuses on people living in single-family rentals since that option is more comparable to homeownership than apartment living. While only a subset of mortgage applications, this group is important to understand since many will become first-time homebuyers. Nationally, 31% of renter households—14 million out of a total of 45 million — live in what we will refer to as single-family homes, which is shorthand for one-unit, single-family detached or attached homes, i.e., single-family homes, co-ops and condominiums.2We use the terms home and house interchangeably and refer to the house they are applying to buy on their application as their intended or desired home instead of as a purchase home since not all applications result in completed mortgages. Throughout this article, mortgage payments include property taxes and insurance.\nWe first look at how typical monthly housing costs change for someone who lives in a single-family rental and is looking to buy.Exhibit 1shows how much larger the median mortgage payment is for an applicant’s intended purchase home over the rent they pay for their current rental house. The first chart is inflation-adjusted to today’s dollars while the second chart is as a percent of their current rent.\nEnlarge Image\nThe typical applicant living in a single-family rental currently would pay around $600 more per month than they pay in rent if they were to complete the purchase of their desired/intended house — 32% higher than their rent. That is far lower than the peak of 60% higher in mid-2006 when speculative demand for housing was high, and lending guidelines were far looser. The 14% decline since the recent peak in late 2023 is because mortgage rates fell from around 8%. The main takeaway is that the typical increase in housing costs from moving from a single-family rental house to owning (if the loan is approved) has grown recently but is similar to the early 2000s and is not at record highs in terms of the percentage increase.\nThis section compares actual single-family rents to estimates of the monthly mortgage payments for a new loan on those same rental homes. This approach allows a true apples-to-apples comparison of owning vs. renting and contrasts favorably with the traditional approach of comparing home price indexes to rent indexes (usually on apartments), which compare different units in different locations.\nFor the primary applicant living in a single-family rental, we estimate the mortgage payment needed to buy their current rental home. We use the same loan terms (mortgage rate, term, and product type) and taxes and insurance (as a percent of the home value) as for the home they intend to purchase, along with a modeled estimate of the current market price of their rental (see the Appendix for additional details).\nExhibit 2ashows the median rents on single-family rentals from loan applications, along with the median of our estimated mortgage payments on those rentals.Exhibit 2bdemonstrates how much higher the typical mortgage payment would be over the typical rent on a single-family home each month.\nEnlarge Image\nIt is clear in Exhibit 2 that both actual rents and estimated mortgage payments on those homes have trended up steeply over the past decade, even after accounting for inflation. This upward trend is consistent with our earlier research indicating that the U.S. has a largehousing shortage. Exhibit 2a makes clear the unfortunate situation of those who don’t currently own a home—the cost of both renting and buying has jumped far faster than inflation over the past ten years.\nWe are not surprised that our estimated monthly costs of ownership at the time of intended purchase are generally higher than rents. Owning has many advantages, such as 1) the building up of equity over time 2) capturing the likely upside from future home price growth 3) control over the property’s appearance and how long you can live there, and 4) the option to lower your costs in the future by refinancing if mortgage rates fall.\nThe gap between the two has also widened recently, as is shown in Exhibit 2b. A value of 0% indicates that the rent is the same as a mortgage would be, with higher values indicate owning is relatively less affordable compared to renting. In September 2024, our estimated monthly mortgage payment is 29% higher than the rent on that same house.3\nThe main takeaway is that while the current percentage difference is high, it is down from when mortgage rates peaked last October and well below the peak in 2006 of 50%. It is also not much higher now than during the early 2000s. We find that even though now is a relatively expensive time to buy compared to renting, it has been far worse.4\nThe spread between mortgage and rent on the same home evolves over time due to a multitude of factors that impact the supply and demand for rentals and homebuyers, such as changes in taxes, lending constraints, or consumer preferences. It is also possible that the perceived advantage of homeownership may be higher than in the past due to rapid rent increases in recent years.5After all, a fixed-rate mortgage is a great inflation hedge in that only the taxes and insurance costs increase over time while the principal and interest components of the mortgage payment don’t increase over the life of the loan. In other words, some components of your mortgage payment can remain constant in the future (or decline if you refinance at a lower rate) as your income (hopefully) increases and inflation pushes up rents. Of course, there are homeownership costs other than the mortgage, such as maintenance, that will grow over time.\nExhibit 3, shows the same analysis as Exhibit 2b for a selection of the most populous metros. Metros tend to move together since mortgage rates are national. Variations across metros are due to differences in home prices and rents, and just from noisier data due to the smaller number of observations than at the national level.\nThere are several takeaways from the regional analysis. Southern metros are experiencing the most relative affordability stress compared to the past. One possible cause for this is the acceleration of the long-standing migration southward triggered by increased work-from-home opportunities and the rising population of retirees. Even though the percentage increase in monthly costs of owning vs. renting remains generally lower than in many large metros in the West and Northeast, the relativity larger increase in the South in recent years may suggest a possible disconnect between home prices and fundamentals worth monitoring. The relatively significant increase in mortgage costs relative to rents may explain in part why home price growth in the South has lagged behind the more affordable Midwest (and even parts of the Northeast) over the past year.\nWe also observe that the lack of affordability relative to rents that has been historically relegated to large coastal markets has increasingly crept into interior markets in the Southeast, Southwest and Rocky Mountains.\nEnlarge Image\nThe highest mortgage payment-to-rent values recently have been in Los Angeles, followed by San Francisco and San Diego. The lowest recent values were in Tampa, Detroit and San Antonio. No MSA is currently at an all-time high.\nIn the previous section, we compared renting to owning the same house as a way of looking at relative affordability. In this section we compare two different homes: the one the borrower is renting and the one they are hoping to purchase and we track how their borrowers adapted to worsening affordability by opting for smaller homes.\nGiven the size of the home is an important variable in a homebuyers decision as it relates to affordability, we investigate the percentage of applicants who intend to buy a larger home. We do that by comparing the size of the rental to the size of the intended purchase in square feet.Exhibit 4presents the percentage of applicants living in single-family rentals that applied to buy larger home.\nEnlarge Image\nThe percentage of loan applications to purchase homes with more square footage than their rental house trended down from a high of 71% in 2013, when home prices had overcorrected to the downside during the housing crash, to 64% in September 2024. The chart shows a slight temporary reversal in the downward trend in 2020 as working from home became more common, before falling again as mortgage rates increased.\nWe suspect the downward trend was driven by worsening affordability, which has forced more prospective homebuyers to settle for smaller homes as compared to in the past.\nThis substitution effect is what economists would expect since people should trade off their consumption choices across various options to get similar enjoyment for the marginal (i.e., last) dollar spent on various options. For example, if the price of beef doubles while the price of chicken stays the same, we expect consumers to eat more chicken and less beef. Relating this back to our analysis, when monthly housing costs increase faster than other costs, we expect prospective homebuyers to try to trim their consumption of housing where possible (e.g., by buying a smaller home or in a less expensive neighborhood) because they are more likely to enjoy spending the marginal difference in housing costs on the consumption of non-housing goods and services.\nThe above analysis focuses on people planning to move from a single-family rental to their own home. There is also a similar decline in the share of applicants fromexisting homeownersapplying for larger homes in recent years from 69% near the start of the pandemic to 65% now.\nWe conclude by tying together the two main types of analysis in this article. The x-axis inExhibit 5shows how much higher a new mortgage payment would be over the rent on the same house (the same data as in Exhibit 2b). The y-axis is the percent of applications for a home with more square feet than their rental home (the same data as in Exhibit 4). Each dot shows the median values for a month starting in June 2000.\nEnlarge Image\nHigher values along the x-axis represent poorer affordability relative to renting, while higher values on the y-axis indicate a higher share of people intending to move to a larger house. Exhibit 5 makes it clear that the higher the cost of owning is relative to renting, the fewer people apply for mortgages for larger homes than their rental. The overall takeaway from this section is that as housing becomes less affordable, there is clear substitution into smaller homes.\nWe cast new light on two key aspects of purchase applications by those living in single-family rental homes. First, we looked at the relative monthly costs of owning vs. renting. We did that by comparing rents on single-family houses to an estimated monthly payment for a new mortgage to buy that same house, as well as to the house the renters wanted to purchase.\nBy comparing owning to the natural alternative of renting, our approach complements more traditional income-based affordability measures by offering an additional way of viewing conditions today compared to the past.\nWe found that poor affordability (from high home prices and mortgage rates) has driven a wide wedge between typical mortgage payments and rents on those homes. Some silver linings are that at least the size of mortgage payments over rents is similar now to the early 2000s, is not as bad as during 2005-2007, and has improved since October 2023, when mortgage rates were near 8%.\nWhen we looked at the largest metros we found wide variability, with home prices generally exceeding rents by a more significant margin in the highest-priced markets, such as along the West Coast. Moreover, the largest deterioration in affordability has occurred in the South and other selected markets in the Southwest and Rocky Mountains.\nThe second contribution of this analysis is identifying a shift in loan applicant’s behavior to cope with worsening affordability. We showed that fewer people are applying to buy larger homes to leave their rental homes. This shift to fewer people moving up is a logical economic response to worsening affordability. The increase in substitution towards smaller, more affordable homes shows that many potential homebuyers dealt with higher mortgage costs by settling for less space. This downsizing effect helps explain why housing demand has held up as well as it has in the face of worsening affordability, in addition to other positive factors such as favorable age demographics and a strong labor market.6\nWe also discovered a strong relationship between these two types of analysis. We found that the higher mortgage payments are relative to rents, the lower the share of purchase applications for a home that has more living space than the rental house they were in.\nHigher mortgage rates and higher prices in the past few years are a major driver behind the relatively high cost of owning compared to renting and the decline in move-ups. We believe the share of people moving up should improve once mortgage rates come down, which many economists forecast will happen over the next year and a half.\nFreddie Mac works hard to provide a variety of programs to make housing more affordable. Promoting housing affordability is more than about fulfilling our charter mission to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing market. It extends to a wide range of other commitments we have made to fulfill our broad mission, including our efforts to stabilize communities, prevent foreclosures, responsibly expand credit, and educate renters and families seeking to become homeowners.\nThe data for this analysis comes from 1.4 million Freddie Mac loan applications from January 2000 through September 2024. Applicants provide their current address and the amount they pay in rent if they are renting.7We then take their rental address and restrict our population to those living in a single-family house.\nFor the primary applicant living in a single-family rental, we estimate the mortgage payment needed to buy their current rental home. We use the same first-lien loan terms (mortgage rate, loan-to-value ratio, term, and product type) and taxes and insurance (as a percent of the home value) as for the home they intend to purchase, along with a modeled estimate of the current market price of their rental. We don’t account for any income tax deduction for interest payments since most people don’t itemize their deductions.\nExhibit Ais an illustration of the loan-level analysis in this article. It shows how we compute what a monthly mortgage payment would be for a new loan on the applicant’s rental home.\nEnlarge Image\nThe point of the example is to aid in understanding how we calculate the final row, since it is used in several exhibits. Values shown in this paper are the medians of the loan-level estimates of monthly mortgage payments relative to rents—which can differ somewhat from a different approach of first taking medians of the rents and the median of the estimated principal, interest, tax, and insurance, and then taking the ratio of those two summary statistics.\nOne way to think about our analysis is that it compares the current rent to mortgage payments if the renter were to buy their rental home. If we instead think about someone looking for a new rental home that doesn’t currently have an existing lease, the relative difference shown in the illustration above and in the some exhibits may be slightly overstated since market rents may be above the rent reported on a loan application. As we expected, our data suggests that rent increases for existing tenants tend to be below the increase in the market rents. Thus, to dampen any bias, we limited our analysis to only properties where the renter has been at that address for a year or less.\nSince we only use loan applications in our origination system from applicants living in single-family rentals, our results don’t address existing homeowners or applicants desiring a jumbo mortgage and should not be generalized to the market as a whole. Of the applicants residing in single-family rentals, close to 80% in recent months are identified as first-time homebuyers, while the rest are applicants planning to return to homeownership after a period of renting.\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\nSam Khater, Chief EconomistRalph DeFranco, Macro Housing Economics Senior DirectorKristine Yao, Macro Housing Economics Director\nhttps://www.freddiemac.com/research\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

Real GDP growth in the first quarter was revised up 0.2 percentage points to 1.6%. Compared to Q1 2024, the increase in Q2 GDP was driven by consumer spending and private inventory investment while residential fixed investment turned negative. Consumer spending rose 2.8 percentage points in Q2 up from the 1.9% contribution in Q1 2024.\nAlong with the third estimate, BEA also released an annual update to the National Accounts, covering the period from Q1 2019 to Q1 2024. The revisions underscore the robustness of the U.S. economy, with the real GDP average annual growth rate revised up from 2.1% to 2.3%. Most of these revisions were driven by consumer spending. Real Gross Domestic Income (GDI), which measures the income side of economic output, had been previously estimated to be below GDP, was revised up from 1.8% to 2.2% average annual growth for the period 2018-2023. The post-pandemic GDI recovery (2021-2023) was also stronger than GDP growth in the same period. The upward revisions to GDI were mainly led by increases in employee compensation. Real personal disposable income for the years from 2021 was also revised higher as compared to the previously published estimates. The personal savings rate saw an upward revision from 3.3% to 5.2% for Q2 2024, and the revised savings rate for 2023 surpassed previous estimates.\nEnlarge Image\nThe latest employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed a very strong rebound in job growth, with the economy adding 254,000 payroll jobs in September and job growth for July and August revised up by a combined 72,000. With the September payroll data, the economy added a total of 1.8 million jobs in the first nine months of 2024, in line with the pre-pandemic (2016-2019) average job growth for the first nine months of the year. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% with layoffs remaining low. Average hourly wage growth rose 4% on a year-over-year basis. Job growth, unemployment and wage growth all beat consensus forecasts and indicate that the U.S. labor market remains resilient.\nJob openings increased from 7.7 million in July to 8 million in August, as per the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey of BLS. Despite a slight downward trend in job openings in recent months, the job openings to unemployed ratio was unchanged at 1.1 over the month in August. Total separations edged slightly lower to 5 million, and the separations rate decreased to 3.1%. Within this, the number of quits decreased to 3.1 million, and the quits rate decreased slightly by 0.1 percentage point to 1.9%. Layoffs were also little changed at 1.6 million and a rate of 1.0%.\nInflationary pressures have been receding over the past few months with the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rising 0.1% over the month in August and 2.7% from a year ago. Prices for goods have been leading the slowdown in overall inflation with a 0.2% monthly decline and a 0.9% yearly decline in August. On the other hand, prices for services continue to rise and were up 0.2% month-over-month and rose 3.7% from a year ago. While the Consumer Price Index (CPI) also continued to trend lower on a year-over-year basis, the shelter index increased 5.2% year-over-year and accounted for over 70% of the yearly increase in CPI.\nThe upward revisions to economic growth along with the revisions to job growth, reiterate the strength of the U.S. economy. With inflation on its path towards the Fed target, and the Federal Reserve’s shift in focus to the objective of maximum employment with the 0.5 percentage point rate cut in September, we reaffirm our optimism for a soft landing in our baseline scenario.\nU.S. housing and mortgage market:Even with declines in mortgage rates to 2-year lows, total (new + existing) home sales declined 2.9% in August, with both existing and new home sales declining over the month. Existing home sales for August fell to the lowest level since October 2010, and new home sales fell to 716,000. Slower sales have coincided with inventory picking up. Months’ supply of existing homes was 4.2 months in August, the highest level since July 2019.\nLower mortgage rates in September helped breathe some life back into the housing market, as evidenced by the slight uptick in the pending home sales index to 70.6 from last month’s historic low of 70.2. However, in early October, the strong jobs report has pushed long-term rates, including mortgage rates, higher which will add to affordability challenges. Despite affordability challenges, the demand for housing has been bolstered by the demographic tailwind from Millennials and Gen Z, who are at prime home-buying age. We take a deeper dive on first-time homebuyers in our spotlight section this month.\nGiven declining mortgage rates, housing construction picked up in August. Single-family housing starts increased 15.8% from July, reversing the losses seen in July. While single-family completions fell 5.6%, multifamily completions increased 36.5% from July and almost 80% from last August. Homebuilder confidence inched up to 41, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ Housing Market Index. Though increasing for the first time in five months, the index remains below 501indicating that building conditions are expected to remain poor in the near term.\nHouse price appreciation continues to slow from the highs we saw in 2022. As measured by the FHFA House Price Index, U.S. house prices rose 0.1% in July 2024 and 4.5% from last year. All nine census divisions showed annual increases, ranging from 7.5% in the East North Central division to 1.6% in the West South-Central division.\nWhile overall mortgage delinquency rates remain low as we highlighted in theSeptember Outlook, it’s important to understand the reasons for the delinquencies. Research has found that it is usually life events which account for a larger share of defaults.2As per the FHFA Foreclosure Prevention and Refinance Report, the top reason for delinquency as of Q2 2024 was curtailment of income at 27%.3This was followed by excessive obligations (17%) and unemployment (15%) as of Q2 2024. Illness of the primary mortgagor or family member was also cited as a reason for delinquency at 11%. National emergency declaration, which was what had happened during COVID and was the main reason for delinquency from Q2 2020 through Q3 2023, was the least common reason in the last couple of quarters at 4%.\nMortgage rates continued to decline and reached a two-year low during the last week of September at 6.08%. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage as measured by Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey®averaged 6.18% in September. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) Weekly Application Survey has shown refinance activity steadily increasing as rates continued to drop in September. Refinance activity accounted for about 55% of total application activity as of the month, a significant increase from August.\nThe U.S. economy grew at a stronger pace than initially reported per the revisions of the BEA national accounts, mainly on strong consumer spending, and we expect it to continue to grow, though at a slower pace. Under our baseline scenario, we expect inflation to continue to trend lower. The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage points in September and indicated further cuts of almost one percentage point in 2024 and another percentage point in 2025. Even though mortgage rates moved lower in anticipation of the rate cut, the most recent employment report has pushed rates higher in early October. Our baseline view has rates easing very gradually over time, with potential volatility as economic news may surprise the market.\nLower mortgage rates are expected to boost the housing market, but the lift will be modest given continued tightness in the existing inventory and homebuyers staying on the sidelines expecting further rate declines. We have seen some loosening in the average mortgage rate lock-in effect. The average rate lock-in effect for Freddie Mac borrowers as of September 2024 is down to $38,000 per borrower compared to the peak of $66,000 per borrower as of October 2023 when rates were at 23-year highs.4This loosening will likely bring more existing inventory into the housing market, but not enough to accommodate growing demand. Therefore, we expect home sales to remain flat in the remainder of 2024 but pick up slightly in 2025 as rates decline further and more housing inventory comes on the market. However, we expect home prices to grow as the supply-demand imbalance remains a core issue in the housing market.\nIn the mortgage market, we anticipate a slight growth in origination volumes in 2024 and 2025 compared to the low volumes in 2023—which were at the lowest since 2014. We forecast purchase origination volumes to continue to increase at a modest pace consistent with modest increases in home sales and house prices. Lower rates are already stimulating refinance volumes, and we expect this trend to continue, thereby pushing up total origination volumes in 2024 and 2025.\nOverall, our outlook for the economy remains optimistic. The Federal Reserve’s 0.5 percentage point cut is expected to have a positive impact on consumer spending and credit performance. However, while inflationary pressures have been declining, there are potential upside risks to inflation. One area where inflation could resurge is housing inflation in an environment where the fundamental mismatch of supply and demand remains a major challenge for the housing market.\nFirst-time homebuyers are an essential and growing segment of the housing market. In this month’s spotlight, we delve into current first-time homebuyer trends. Using Freddie Mac data, we show their increasing role in housing demand, a trend that should continue thanks to favorable demographics. We also explore the geographic preferences of first-time buyers, identifying the regions where their share has grown the fastest over the last five years. Finally, we consider headwinds that might hinder first-time homebuyer activity in the near future.\nMillennials are now of prime homebuying age, and Gen Z’s oldest members are entering the workforce. These two cohorts will become the driving force in the housing market in the coming years and add to the pool of first-time buyers. Additionally, young adults who are renting are making more money now than in prior years, even after adjusting for inflation.Exhibit 2shows renter households between 25 and 44 years of age with real (inflation-adjusted) earnings of at least $75,000. Since 2012, the number of potential first-time homebuyers has been rising substantially, and as of 2023, there were three million of these households.\nEnlarge Image\nIndeed, these favorable demographic and economic tailwinds are helping first-time homebuyers become a more significant presence in the housing market. Using Freddie Mac-funded loan data, we can examine the historical share of conventional conforming loans that went to first-time homebuyers.Exhibit 3shows that the share of first-time homebuyers has consistently been growing since 2004, from around 20% of funded loans to over 50% as of the second quarter of 2024.\nOne possible explanation for the recent increase in the share of first-time buyers is that repeat buyers are less active in the market due to the mortgage lock-in effect. From 2018 through 2022 the share of first-time homebuyers was steady at around 45% of funded loans. That share increased in 2023 and 2024 as the rate lock-in effect chilled the home resale market. However, even if the entirety of the increase from 2022 through 2024 was due to the rate lock effect, first-time homebuyers would still represent a significant share of all activity. And if the rate lock-in effect persists, then that underscores the importance of first-time homebuyers as one of the few sources of growing housing demand in the current environment.\nEnlarge Image\nUsing our Freddie Mac data, we can also examine states which have seen the most activity with respect to first-time homebuyers. Overall, we see consistent growth in the share for most states; however, states in the Northeast and Midwest have relatively higher shares of first-time homebuyers, especially in recent years.\nExhibit 4shows how much the first-time homebuyer share of Freddie Mac-funded loans has increased from 2019 to the most recent four quarters, ending with the second quarter of 2024. The map suggests that the first-time homebuyer share is growing faster in areas with moderate or slower home sale activity. Conversely, retiree destinations where repeat buyers are abundant, like Arizona and Florida, saw lower first-time homebuyer share increase over the last five years.\nWhile there is tremendous demand potential from these cohorts, there are headwinds which might hinder first-time buyer activity in the near term. In this section we identify three of the most pressing issues affecting first-time buyers.\nPeople attempting to buy their first home today must navigate an environment of higher mortgage rates and house prices. Even though mortgage rates are back to averaging under 6.5% in recent weeks, many who bought their starter homes before the 2022 mortgage rate increases have little incentive to sell to the incoming cohorts of new buyers. More importantly, starter home price appreciation has exceeded other appreciation in the other segments of the housing market.Exhibit 5shows the cumulative gap in house price appreciation between entry-level homes (defined as homes that sell at 75% of the median or below) versus high-end homes (defined as homes that sell at 125% of the median or higher). Between January 2000 and July 2024, cumulative entry-level prices grew 63% more than high-end home prices. Less affordable housing is acutely felt by those seeking to buy their first homes, especially those without substantial wealth at their disposal.\nEnlarge Image\nWe can’t bring up affordability issues without discussing the lack of supply in the housing market. The supply deficit has its roots in the lack of residential construction post-Great Financial Crisis and was exacerbated due to a surge in demand during the pandemic.Exhibit 6shows the number of renter households per homes for sale. The number of renters per homes for sale has been trending up since 2006, rising from less than 10 to above 30 renter households per home available. Therefore, not only do people seeking to buy their first home have to navigate an expensive market, but they also have to compete with more first-time buyers as supply continues to trail demand.\nEnlarge Image\nThe Federal Reserve’s tight monetary policy has helped ease inflation over the last few years. However, higher interest rates (among other factors) have also contributed to higher unemployment. The U.S. unemployment rate increased half a percentage point from 3.7% in January 2024 to 4.2% in August. Renter households, especially, are seeing a faster acceleration in the unemployment rate than homeowner households. This trend is something to consider in the context of future first-time homebuyer activity, as many future buyers are currently renting.Exhibit 7shows that the renter unemployment rate has increased from about 5% to over 6% since 2023. On the other hand, the unemployment rate of owner-occupied households has remained relatively flat. There could be disproportionate impacts on first-time homebuyer activity if labor conditions were to tighten and renters are the first to feel the pinch.\nEnlarge Image\nThroughout the country, we see the perseverance of first-time homebuyers as they navigate through stubbornly complex market dynamics. That’s why Freddie Mac continues to work closely with lenders and community organizations to help people achieve their personal housing goals. For example, we offer a variety ofcustomized loan productsto help first-time buyers overcome housing challenges and become homeowners. In the second quarter of 2024 alone, we financed approximately 200,000 primary home purchases, 53% of which were for first-time homebuyers. We’ve also launched an innovative platform to help potential buyers work with their lender to find down payment assistance programs. These are just some of the ways we are working to Make Home Possible.\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\nSam Khater, Chief EconomistLen Kiefer, Deputy Chief EconomistAjita Atreya, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerRama Yanamandra, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerPenka Trentcheva, Macro & Housing Economics SeniorGenaro Villa, Macro & Housing Economics SeniorCaroline Cheatham, Finance Analyst\nhttps://www.freddiemac.com/research\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

Consumer spending grew the fastest of all components, rising at an annualized rate of 2.9% in Q2, which was up from 1.5% in Q1 2024. Consumer spending contributed two percentage points to overall GDP in Q2 2024, up from one percentage point in the previous quarter. Private inventory investment also contributed to the acceleration of real GDP in Q2. However, these upturns were partially offset by a decrease in fixed residential investment.\nThe latest employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) points to a cooling labor market. August’s total nonfarm payroll gains were 142,000. Though a bounce back from July, August’s job growth was still below the average monthly gain of 202,000 over the past year. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%, slightly lower than last month’s highest rate since November 2021. In terms of the job growth by industry, manufacturing saw a decline over the month, reflecting a slowdown in the durable goods industries.\nJob openings moderated from 7.9 million in June to 7.7 million in July, dipping further below the 8.8 million openings reported in July of last year, per the BLS. The number of job openings are now at the lowest level since January 2021. The job openings to unemployed ratio for July is at 1.07 and remains at the lowest since June 2021, while still above the pre-pandemic average (2016-2019) of 0.99.\nInflation continues to moderate. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2% month-over-month and was up 2.5% year-over-year in July 2024.1Prices for goods were unchanged month-over-month whereas services increased 0.2% month-over-month and 3.7% year-over-year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% month-over-month in July after declining 0.1% in June. The index rose 2.9% year-over-year, which is the smallest 12-month increase since March of 2021. Core CPI also increased 0.2% month-over-month, slightly higher than June’s increase of 0.1%. The month-over-month energy index was unchanged in July after declining for two preceding months. Though July’s inflation data shows acceleration from last month, almost 90% of the increase in both headline and core CPI was driven by shelter prices.\nAccording to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS), credit conditions have begun to ease. The net percentage of banks raising credit standards moved down to 7.9% in Q2 2024, a decrease from 15.6% in Q1 2024. This is the lowest percentage since the Federal Reserve began to tighten policy in 2022. Looking at consumer lending, a moderate net share of banks (between 10% and 20%) reported tightening lending standards for credit cards and other consumer loans lowered credit limits. Standards for auto loans were unchanged, but a moderate net share of banks reported experiencing weaker demand for these loans. A significant share (between 20% and 50%) of banks tightened standards for commercial real estate loans, while residential real estate lending standards changed little.\nThe broad economy continues to expand, though it shows signs of slowing, which are consistent with a soft landing. The labor market is cooling with unemployment up and job growth moderating. Inflationary pressures are abating, and consumer price growth is on a path back toward 2%, which policymakers judge consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\nU.S. housing and mortgage market:The decline in mortgage rates in July gave a slight nudge upward to home sales with total (existing + new) home sales for July rising 2.6% over the month to 4.7 million. Both existing and new home sales rose over the month of July. Pending home sales (a leading indicator of upcoming home sales) declined 5.5% month-over-month in July with all four U.S. regions declining in transactions monthly. Affordability challenges continue to impact the market as the pending home sales index level of 70.2 is the lowest reading since the index began tracking in 2001.\nThe homebuilder confidence index fell further to 39 in August from 41 a month earlier, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ Housing Market Index. The index remains below the threshold of 50, indicating poor building conditions over the next six months. Poor affordability from higher interest rates continue to weigh on builder sentiment. However, we have yet to see the impact of the falling rates on housing construction as it continues to decline. Housing starts for July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.24 million, 6.8% below June’s 1.33 million units. Single family housing starts fell 14.1% from the previous month and were 14.8% below last July’s levels.\nHouse prices for June 2024 as measured by the FHFA House Price Index, declined 0.1% month-over-month in June and rose 5.1% year-over-year. The monthly slowdown in appreciation this June could be attributed to elevated mortgage rates and a higher inventory of homes for sale. The states with the highest annual house price appreciation were Vermont at 13.4%, West Virginia at 12.3%, Rhode Island at 10.1% and Delaware at 10%.\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.5% in August as measured by Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey®and ended the month at 6.35%. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) Weekly Application Survey, mortgage activity was slightly higher, driven by a pick-up in refinance activity. Refinance activity rose given falling mortgage rates and accounted for 46.4% of the total application activity as of the end of August. Despite the fourth consecutive week of declining mortgage rates, purchase applications have not shown much movement as prospective homebuyers remain patient in the wake of declining rates and the increasing levels of for-sale inventory.\nIn terms of mortgage delinquencies, per the MBA’s mortgage delinquency survey, a seasonally adjusted (SA) 3.97% of outstanding debt was in some stage of delinquency as of Q2 2024, up three basis points from Q1 2024 and up 60 basis points year-over-year. Loans 30+ days delinquent ticked up one basis point from 2.25% in Q1 2024 to 2.26% in Q2 2024 and rose 51 basis points from Q2 2023. Loans in foreclosure decreased three basis points from last quarter to 0.43% in Q2 2024 and decreased 10 basis points year-over-year (SA). In terms of seriously delinquent loans (which is 90 days or more past due or in foreclosure), only VA loans saw an uptick from 2.01% in Q1 2024 to 2.07% in Q2 2024, down from 2.15% in Q2 2023, non-seasonally adjusted (NSA). The overall share of seriously delinquent loans declined from 1.44% in Q1 to 1.43% in Q2 2024 and was down 18 basis points from Q2 2023. The share of conventional loans was down from 1.06% in Q1 to 1.04% in Q2 2024, down from 1.61% in Q2 2023 and the share of FHA loans declined from 3.18% to 3.17% during the first and second quarter of the year and down from 3.71% in Q2 2023 (NSA), as shown inExhibit 1. While early-stage delinquencies have been rising modestly, serious delinquency rates continue to fall, indicating that homeowners are able to deal with short-term distress and avoid serious delinquencies and foreclosures.\nEnlarge Image\nOverall, while mortgage rates declined from 6.85% in July to 6.5% in August, that may not be enough to give a boost to housing demand as homebuyers continue to wait for rates to decline further. On the supply side, housing construction remains low. Mortgage performance continues to be strong, especially for conventional borrowers.\nDespite the cooling labor market, our outlook for the economy still calls for a soft landing. We expect economic growth to continue, albeit at a slower pace. Under our baseline scenario, inflation is expected to cool further. The discourse around the timing and pace of potential future rate cuts will likely drive the near-term path of interest rates rather than the actual policy decision itself. While there is likely to be some volatility around any policy statements, we expect mortgages rates to decline further, though remaining above 6% by year-end.\nWe expect housing demand to improve, supported by lower mortgage rates. However, we do not expect home sales to get a significant boost because a modest improvement in affordability is insufficient to significantly increase the pool of buyers—particularly the first-time home buyers who are driving demand in the housing market. In addition, the housing inventory in the resale market is still struggling to gain momentum, mainly due to the rate lock effect. Unless rates fall significantly—something in the order of a full percentage point or more—we do not expect inventory of existing homes to come on the market in large numbers, limiting supply. We expect home sales to remain muted in 2024 and 2025. However, the tight supply and solid demand are expected to put upward pressure on home prices. We, therefore, expect home prices to continue to appreciate at a modest pace in 2024 and 2025.\nBased on our expectation of muted home sales but increases in home prices, we forecast purchase mortgage origination volume to grow modestly. We expect the decline in the mortgage rates to slightly boost refinance originations. Overall, our forecast for total origination is a modest volume increase in 2024 and 2025.\nOverall, our outlook remains optimistic. While prospective homebuyers continue to face affordability challenges due to high home prices, homeowners are experiencing significant wealth gains which makes them less vulnerable to adverse economic events. Under our baseline scenario, we do not foresee the economy going into recession.\nHouseholds in the U.S. and worldwide are grappling with more frequent and intense natural disasters. This year alone, as of September 2024, there have been 20 confirmed weather/climate disaster events, each causing losses exceeding $1 billion. In 2023, nearly one out of five households reported being financially affected by natural disasters, according to the Survey of Household Economics and Decision Making (SHED). Almost two-thirds of those financially affected reported a loss of income/work disruption or property damage. Moreover, over a third of the survey respondents believe the likelihood that they will experience a natural disaster is higher five years from now.\nAs households face various financial and non-financial challenges during natural disasters, their response can considerably shape the future of real estate markets, particularly their location choice and housing protection against natural disaster risk. In this Spotlight, we analyze how households have responded to severe weather events, whether respondents have taken any actions against the risk and how it differs by their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics using the SHED. Below, we discuss three key takeaways from our analysis.\nPeople move homes for various reasons. While the overall move rate in the U.S. has declined over the years, the most often cited reason for moving is housing-related, such as wanting to own a home instead of renting, searching for cheaper housing and better neighborhoods, etc.2As extreme weather events have become more common, households in the U.S. have increasingly been investigating other places in which to relocate. Our analysis of the SHED shows that in 2023, 1 in 7 households reported investigating other places to live because of natural disaster threats.\nExhibit 2shows the share of respondents by housing type, tenure and demographic characteristics who reported that they investigated other places to live in 2023:\nNotably, a larger share (around 16%) of respondents aged 18-44 investigated other places to live, which is almost double the share of respondents above 60 and suggests that younger households are more prone to relocate due to the threat of natural disasters. Interestingly, those earning less than $50,000 in household annual income and a larger share of households in the West investigated other places to live in 2023. While there has been a notable rise in drought and longer wildfire seasons in the West, the larger share of renters in this region offers more flexibility for more households to relocate. For example, according to the SHED, in the West, 31% of respondents were renters, as contrasted with the Midwest, South and Northeast where 23%, 25% and 29% of respondents were renters respectively. Similarly, a large share of those earning less than $50,000 were renters, and in 2023, 45% of the respondents ages 18-29 and 34% ages 30-44 were renters.\nEnlarge Image\nIt’s important to note that some households are at a greater risk of experiencing adverse impacts of natural disasters than others. The SHED reveals a significant contrast in the financial impact of natural disasters on different income groups and ethnicities. For instance, in 2023, according to the SHED, one in four households earning less than $25,000 was financially affected by a natural disaster, compared to nearly one in six for those earning over $50,000. Similarly, 16.8% of Whites were financially affected, while the share for Blacks was 20.5%, for Hispanics was 23.3%, and for Asians was 22.2%. In addition to being financially affected, a larger share of low-income households and minorities needed to evacuate temporarily or were displaced for longer term due to natural disasters in 2023.Exhibit 3shows that 12-13% of respondents earning less than $50,000 and a similar share of Black and Hispanic respondents needed to evacuate temporarily due to natural disaster in 2023.\nEnlarge Image\nOne of the ways to prepare for future natural disaster risk is by investing in improving the property to reduce risk. Among the homeowners, we find that in 2023, 23.3% of homeowners made some improvements to their property to reduce risk, a jump from 17.6% of homeowners who made improvements in 2022 (Exhibit 4). We also find connection between experiencing natural disasters and investing in property improvements. For example, those earning $25,000-50,000 were among the larger shares evacuated temporarily or displaced for longer term due to natural disasters and a larger share of the same population improved the property to reduce risk compared to other income categories. Similarly, almost three out of ten Hispanic and Black households, who were among the larger share that were evacuated temporarily or displaced longer term, improved their property to reduce risk compared to their counterparts.\nEnlarge Image\nHomeowners insurance provides financial protection against physical damage to a property. While homes with mortgages are required to hold homeowners’ insurance, additional insurance offers additional protection in the event of a natural disaster. We find that only 5% of the households in 2023 bought additional insurance, which was unchanged from 2022. Beliefs about future natural disaster risk should play a significant role in an individual’s decision making around purchasing additional insurance to protect against the risk. As expected, we find that a larger share of those who believe that the chance they will experience a natural disaster is higher five years from now purchased additional insurance. Despite this belief, the affordability of homeowners insurance is a significant hurdle, as we discussed in a previousSpotlight, which examines the impact of rising insurance costs on households’ ability to protect themselves against natural disaster risks.\nWith respect to the decision to buy additional insurance, homeowners with a mortgage are more likely to buy additional insurance as compared to homeowners who own their homes free and clear. Renters are as likely as homeowners with a mortgage to buy additional insurance, as shown inExhibit 5. Unsurprisingly, higher income households are more likely to buy additional insurance, which protects them more than low-income households. Young households seem to protect themselves more with additional insurance. Interestingly, a larger share of minorities, particularly Black households, bought additional insurance in 2023 compared to White households.\nEnlarge Image\nIn summary, more people today are concerned about natural disaster risk and believe the likelihood they will experience a natural disaster is higher five years from now. Households can take several measures to safeguard themselves and protect their home against future natural disaster risks. Households can either relocate to safer places, improve the property they currently live in, or buy additional insurance for more financial protection (among other measures). Our analysis shows that renters are more likely to consider relocating due to the threat of natural disaster, highlighting the critical factor of younger age and renter flexibility in relocation decisions. On the other hand, homeowners proactively improve their properties to reduce future natural hazard risk. While not a large share, both homeowners with mortgages and renters can benefit from additional insurance coverage. Overall, flexibility to relocate, direct impact from natural disasters, and beliefs about future risks are motivating factors in preparing against future natural disaster risks.\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\nSam Khater, Chief EconomistLen Kiefer, Deputy Chief EconomistAjita Atreya, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerRama Yanamandra, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerPenka Trentcheva, Macro & Housing Economics SeniorGenaro Villa, Macro & Housing Economics SeniorCaroline Cheatham, Finance Analyst\nhttps://www.freddiemac.com/research\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

This growth was led by consumption spending, private inventory buildup and non-residential investment. Consumption spending accelerated to 2.3% annualized growth in Q2 from the 1.5% in Q1 2024, with the contribution of this component to GDP growth increasing to 1.6 percentage points in Q2 2024 from 0.9 percentage points in Q1 2024. Changes in private inventory contributed 0.82 percentage points to Q2 2024 growth. One possible explanation for the increase in inventories could be that retailers are increasing inventory for holiday orders much earlier to insure against future shipping disruptions that have occurred since the pandemic.\nNon-residential investment increased 5.2% on an annualized basis, the strongest growth in a year, indicating that business investment remains robust. In contrast, residential investment came in negative, marking the first decline after three quarters of consecutive growth. Another key metric, final sales to private domestic purchasers, which measures U.S. residents’ spending, removing inventories and exports but adding imports, rose 2.6% in Q2, following a 2.4% increase in Q1 2024.\nThe latest employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) points to a softer labor market. July’s total nonfarm payroll gains were 114,000 while total employment gains for May and June were revised down by 29,000 (2,000 for May and 27,000 for June). However, the three-month moving average of job gains remains strong at 170,000. The unemployment rate ticked up further to 4.3% and remains at its highest since November 2021. The labor force participation rate ticked up to 62.7% in June from 62.5% in May with the prime age participation at 84%. Average hourly earnings rose 3.6% year-over-year. This is less than last month but is still above the pre-pandemic (2016-2019) average of 2.9%. Along with that, the employment cost index rose less than expected as inflation continued to ease. The year-over-year gains in total compensation costs grew at the slowest pace since 2022.\nJob openings moderated slightly in June to 8.18 million from 8.23 million in May, remaining at the lowest level since March 2021. The job openings to unemployed ratio for June was 1.2, the lowest level since June 2021 and closer to the 2019 average. The quits rate was 2.1% for June with the number of quits at the lowest level since November 2020. The number of hires at 5.3 million was the lowest since April 2017; the hires rate is at its lowest level since February 2014, if we ignore the pandemic recession.\nInflation has been moderating towards the Fed target. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2% month-over-month and was up 2.6% year-over-year in June 2024.1Prices for goods decreased 0.2% month-over-month offsetting the increases in prices for services. Energy prices continued to decline. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June was favorable with a 0.1% decline in the headline price level month-over-month and a year-over-year growth of 3.0%.2The monthly CPI decline was the first since the pandemic (May 2020) and the year-over-year change in CPI was the lowest since March 2021. Core CPI came in at 0.1% month-over-month and 3.3% year over year in June. Monthly gains in shelter inflation were at the lowest level since August 2021, both for the rent of primary residence and the owner equivalent rent. Despite coming in at the lowest level since August 2021, the year-over-year increase in shelter accounted for nearly 70% of the total increase in core CPI.\nOverall, the U.S. economy remains strong. Strong growth for Q2 2024 was led by consumption spending by higher income consumers, who have seen an increase in wealth due to the rise in returns from financial assets as well as home equity.3However, the labor market has been cooling with a slowdown in job growth. Moderating inflationary pressures are paving the way for the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates soon.\nU.S. housing and mortgage market:The housing market continues to reel under the impact of high mortgage rates. Total (existing + new) home sales for June came in at 4.5 million, the lowest level since July 2011. Both existing and new home sales declined in June. Existing home sales were at 3.89 million (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in June, declining 5.4% month-over-month and down 5.4% year-over-year.4New home sales were at 617,000 in June, down 0.6% month-over-month and down 7.4% year-over-year.5Both existing and new home inventory improved in June but remains below the pre-pandemic average.6While inventory of existing homes picked up 23% year-over-year to 1.32 million units, the number of homes available for sale remains well below the pre-pandemic average of 1.8 million units. With respect to the new home inventory, while inventory of new homes remains at the highest level since January 2008, almost 3/5th of the homes for sale are under construction with only around 1/5th completed. The remaining 1/5th are those for which construction has not started. Months’ supply of existing homes also picked up to 4.1 months. This is the first time that supply has been above 4 months since October 2020.\nHomebuilder confidence fell further to 42 in June from 43 a month earlier, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ Housing Market Index. The decline is below the threshold of 50, indicating poor building conditions over the next six months. Higher mortgage rates continue to dampen builder sentiment.7Housing construction saw an uptick in June with new residential construction up 3% month-over-month to 1.35 million units, even as starts were 4% lower than the level seen last June. Single-family starts declined 2% month-over-month, while multifamily starts increased by 10%.\nHouse prices, as measured by the Freddie Mac House Price Index (FMHPI) rose 0.2% in June and were up 5.2% over the year. Overall, since December 2019, house prices grew by almost 50% in nominal terms. However, the inflation-adjusted (real) house price growth since 2019 has been more moderate than what the nominal rates suggest. Additionally, price dynamics have evolved distinctly since 2019 for different markets nationwide. For example, zoom towns (communities that experienced a significant population increase during the pandemic due to an influx of remote workers) saw significant house price appreciation right after the pandemic started, but since then, have had appreciation abate and even turn negative in some metros. One way to gauge house price growth since the pandemic would be to calculate the compound annual growth rate, which measures what the annual growth rate would need to be for inflation-adjusted house prices to grow from their 2019 levels to where they are now. By looking at the real compound annual growth rate, we can smooth out the volatility house prices have experienced since 2020 while also adjusting for the high inflation.\nExhibit 1maps out the inflation-adjusted compound annual growth rate by metros. At the national level, the real average growth rate has been at around 5% annually since December 2019. Even after adjusting for inflation, metros in the Southeast and Northeast have experienced relatively more robust growth than other regions. Specifically, markets in Florida and Tennessee have seen strong average real growth as these states witnessed higherin-migrationdue to the warmer weather and more affordable housing supply. Conversely, Southeast Texas, the Permian Basin, Louisiana, and Northern California metros have seen softer inflation-adjusted house price growth.\nEnlarge Image\nThe rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.85% in July, as measured by Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey®and ended the month at 6.78%. Despite the rate drop from 6.92% in June to 6.85% in July, mortgage activity remained muted. Per the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) Weekly Application Survey, mortgage activity decreased over the month as homebuyers have yet to respond to these lower rates. Sometimes as rates decline, demand weakens, and the apparent paradox is driven by buyers hoping rates will not fall further before they decide to purchase. Overall mortgage activity was down 2.6% month-over-month and was up 0.2% year-over-year at the end of July. Refinance activity during the last week of July was up 4.9% compared to the same week a month earlier, while purchase applications were down 7.1% month-over-month at the end of July.\nHigher mortgage rates and low affordability impacted the homeownership rate in Q2 2024. The homeownership rate was slightly lower at 65.6% in Q2 2024 compared to the rate observed in Q2 2023 of 65.9%, as per the Q2 2024 Residential Vacancies and Homeownership Report by the U.S. Census Bureau. Between Q2 2023 and Q2 2024, the total number of housing units rose from 145.1 million to 146.6 million, an increase of 1.6 million units. Occupied units increased by 1.4 million while vacant units rose by 0.2 million. Most notably, the increase in occupied housing units was primarily driven by renter-occupied units which increased by 0.8 million units (1.9%) from 44.3 million in Q2 2023 to 45.2 million in Q2 2024. On the other hand, owner occupied units increased only 0.5 million units (0.6%) from 85.7 million to 86.3 million. The homeowner vacancy rate ticked up from 0.8% in Q1 to 0.9% in Q2 2024 and was up from 0.7% in Q2 2023, while the renter vacancy rate remained unchanged from Q1 2024 at 6.6% but was up from 6.3% a year ago.\nOverall, despite rates being almost 50 basis points lower than they were at the beginning of May, and slowing in the rate of house price appreciation, housing demand remains weak as reflected in lower home sales and lower applications. Many potential homebuyers continue to pause due to poor affordability as they await further declines in rates.\nThe overall economy continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace than during the second half of last year. Under our baseline scenario, we expect the slower growth to persist as the labor market weakens further this year and next. With the backdrop of favorable inflation data and a softening labor market, we anticipate the Federal Reserve to initiate rate cuts sooner rather than later. Our baseline scenario predicts a further cooling of inflation, but we expect inflation to remain above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2% in 2024 and 2025. The anticipation of an upcoming rate cut is already influencing the market, leading to downward pressure on mortgage rates. As a result, we forecast mortgage rates to gradually decline in the coming quarters.\nOn the housing market, high mortgage rates and high home prices have led some prospective buyers to step back. However, with the expectation of mortgage rates cooling further, we anticipate a significant surge in demand mainly from the first-time homebuyers left at the margins. We also expect lower rates to loosen the rate lock-in effect to some extent, providing some boost to inventory—although it should be minimal, given the bulk of existing homeowners have locked-in rates below 6%. Despite some loosening, the tight inventory (due to a decade of under construction, further exacerbated by the rate lock-in effect) is still expected to limit home sales. We expect home sales to increase modestly the remainder of the year and 2025 while remaining below 6 million annually. Supported by solid demand, we expect upward pressure on home prices and forecast home prices to rise by 2.1% in 2024 and 0.6% in 2025.\nOur forecast for total mortgage origination is a modest volume increase in 2024 and 2025. This forecast is based on several factors including the expectation of modestly improved home sales and an increase in home prices, which should stimulate purchase originations. We expect refinance volumes to remain flat in 2024 and improve slightly in 2025 as rates decline further in 2025.\nOverall, our outlook remains optimistic. While prospective homebuyers continue to face affordability challenges due to high home prices, homeowners are experiencing significant wealth gains which makes them less vulnerable to adverse economic events. Under our baseline scenario, we do not foresee the economy going into recession.\nHigher mortgage rates since 2022 have dampened refinance activity. Given that the average mortgage rate on outstanding loans as of Q1 2024 was at 4.1% and mortgage rates at the end of Q2 2024 were at 6.9%, homeowners have little incentive to refinance.9However, homeowners may still choose to refinance for reasons other than to lower their mortgage rate, such as extracting equity through cash-out refinances, extending the loan term or refinancing to cancel private mortgage insurance payments.Exhibit 2shows first-lien refinance originations since 1990 in inflation-adjusted 2023 dollars. The quarterly volume in Q2 2024 at $62 billion is the lowest since Q3 1996 and the volume in the first half of 2024 ($147 billion) is the weakest since the first half of 1995.\nEnlarge Image\nIn the first half of 2024, around 85% of conventional refinance originations were cash-out refinances. This shift is largely due to higher rates, which have reduced the number of rate-and-term refinances and are pushing up the share of cash-out refinances, even as total refinance volumes remain low.Exhibit 3shows the trends in conventional cash-out refinance activity over time. As of the first half of 2024, an average of $93,000 was extracted as cash-out, accounting for 24% of the average total property value. However, the total equity cashed out was only around $25 billion dollars during the first half of 2024. For 2023, the total amount of cash-out refinance was $49 billion, down from $144 billion in 2022, and well below the $485 billion that was extracted in 2006. Given the rise in home equity, the total equity cash-out remains low at around 0.04% as of Q2 2024. Cash-out equity has remained at this level for a year and a half (Exhibit 4).\nEnlarge Image\nEnlarge Image\nExhibit 5shows borrowers’ loan term choices from Q1 1994 through Q2 2024. In the last year and a half, there has been a noticeable shift in borrowers’ preferences. Fewer borrowers are choosing to refinance into a shorter-term mortgage with many borrowers now opting to refinance into the same term mortgage or increase their term to lower their monthly payments. Among the borrowers who refinanced in the first two quarters of 2024, 8% reduced their loan term, a slight increase from the historical low of just 5% during Q4 2023. In terms of mortgage rates, borrowers who refinanced in 2023 and early 2024 saw an increase of 2.4 and 1.9 percentage points, respectively.\nEnlarge Image\nRefinance volumes remain low for now due to high mortgage rates but the anticipated Fed rate cuts in the second half of the year should ease mortgage rates in the second half of 2024 and further into 2025. This easing of mortgage rates should help boost refinance volumes in 2025 after remaining fairly flat in 2024. While rates have been a barrier to refinances, record high home equity, which was at around $33 trillion as of Q1 2024, should continue to support cash-out refinances.\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\nSam Khater, Chief EconomistLen Kiefer, Deputy Chief EconomistRalph DeFranco, Macro Housing Economics Senior DirectorAjita Atreya, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerRama Yanamandra, Macro & Housing Economics ManagerPenka Trentcheva, Macro & Housing Economics SeniorGenaro Villa, Macro & Housing Economics Senior\nhttps://www.freddiemac.com/research\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.
