    "text": "In the early years of the 20th century, homeownership was a cherished dream for many families. Yet without the long-term, fixed rate mortgage most homeowners have today, saving for a down payment was tough, loans were short-term, and large balloon payments awaited when those notes came due.\nDuring the Great Depression, nearly a quarter of the nation’s homeowners lost their homes to foreclosure. Banks simply didn’t have the funds to make mortgage loans. To address the situation, the United States government created Fannie Mae and charged it with the mission it continues to serve today: to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability in the mortgage market.\nFannie Mae helped banks finance a new type of mortgage: the long-term, fixed-rate home loan. The innovative mortgage loan expanded access to affordable homeownership, offered homeowners more certainty about their monthly mortgage payments, and transformed the housing industry.\nAt Fannie Mae, we continue our mission to help make stable, efficient, and affordable mortgage loans available in the United States. We strive to be America’s most valued housing partner by maintaining responsible risk management for sustainable housing finance and leading with innovative mortgage solutions.\nDuring the Great Depression, there was a recognized need for a reliable, steady source of funding for housing. At the time, affordable mortgage credit was inaccessible for many families.\nFannie Mae financed home purchases for millions of American soldiers returning from World War II. The nation’s economy grew rapidly and the liquidity Fannie Mae provided allowed mortgage lenders to have the cash on hand to meet the demand.\nHomeownership grew throughout the country during the second half of the 20th century and fueled the rise of the middle class. The Charter Act reorganized Fannie Mae from a government agency into a mixed ownership corporation in 1954.\nIn the 1968 Housing and Urban Development Act, Fannie Mae became a private shareholder-owned corporation chartered by the U.S. Congress. After being removed from the federal budget, Fannie Mae funded its operations through stock and bond markets.\nIn the 1980s, the development of mortgage-backed securities brought capital from global markets to the U.S. housing industry. Fannie Mae securitized mortgage loans and guaranteed payment to investors, which it continues to do today.\nHousing prices plummeted and delinquencies rose during the financial crisis, and the government-sponsored enterprises lost billions of dollars on investment portfolios and mortgage-backed security guarantees. The federal government put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nThe company returned to profitability in 2012.  In 2014, Fannie Mae had paid back all funds it received when it first went under conservatorship and has since put billions into the U.S. Treasury."

Instead, we purchase mortgage loans made by lenders, who are then able to use those funds to offer mortgage loans to more people. We partner with mortgage lenders and servicers, housing counselors, real estate agents, nonprofit organizations, and other industry professionals to help people obtain a home and stay in that home when faced with hardship or disaster.\nFannie Mae's work — expanding access and opportunity — is focused on two primary types of housing.\nOur Single-Family business helps homebuyers purchase and refinance homes. We support mortgage lenders by acquiring the mortgage loans they originate. We package loans we acquire into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that we guarantee, attracting investors to the U.S. secondary mortgage market. Our financing solutions enable lenders to offer 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which provide homeowners stable, predictable mortgage payments over the life of their loans.\nWe develop and maintain underwriting and eligibility standards for Fannie Mae loans.

    "text": "While our role providing liquidity and stability to the residential mortgage market and promoting affordable access to mortgage credit has remained constant, we’ve strengthened our business model significantly since entering conservatorship. This makes us better able to withstand market fluctuations and respond to risk. And we’re better prepared to serve homebuyers and renters in good times and tough times.\nPreviously, we earned most of our revenue by holding a large investment portfolio of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Today, we have drastically reduced our portfolio and shifted to a more stable, guaranty fee-driven business model. Our model is focused on receiving a steady stream of monthly fees to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on the mortgage-backed securities we sell to American and global investors.\nAs we’ve transitioned our business model, we’ve achieved 13 straight years of annual profitability. We’ve now paid approximately $181 billion to the Treasury in senior preferred stock dividends, which is about $62 billion more than we have received in support from the government since 2008. And in just the past 5 years, when we’ve been permitted to retain our earnings, we’ve increased our net worth by over $81 billion, resulting in nearly $95 billion of net worth as of the end of 2024.\nWe provide financing every day to help strengthen the housing market, which contributes to the economy, job growth, and a better quality of life across America. Our role is even more critical in tough moments for the economy. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many other financial institutions held back their mortgage purchases, which would have prevented many people from securing a mortgage or refinancing. Fannie Mae stepped in and provided additional support, increasing our mortgage purchases to ensure a strong housing market and help the economy.\nAt the same time, we developed innovative and flexible tools for mortgage companies to help renters and homeowners impacted by the pandemic. For homeowners facing financial hardships, we offered the option to suspend or delay mortgage payments up to 18 months. We helped more than 1.4 million homeowners under this plan.\nFannie Mae stepped in during the pandemic to support access to homeownership\nTo help ensure we are able to meet the housing market’s needs in times of stress, the U.S. government has established rigorous bank-like capital requirements that we will be required to meet to allow us to operate during difficult economic periods. We are building our capital reserves to meet these requirements.\nAt the same time, since entering conservatorship, we’ve focused on improving the resilience and credit quality of the book of mortgages we guarantee. This greater resilience is shown in the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (known as DFAST) our regulator mandates that we conduct to assess our ability to withstand difficult economic conditions. Over the past few years, our DFAST results have shown limited or no pre-tax losses during severe economic downturn scenarios that were far worse than the 2008 financial crisis. This underscores the strength of our business and its ability to serve as a source of stability in the market today and in the future.\n12017 GAAP net income includes a $9.9B provision for federal income taxes resulting from the remeasurement of Fannie Mae’s deferred tax assets due to the corporate tax reduction in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n2Dividend payments do not reduce the senior preferred stock’s liquidation preference, which includes cumulative amounts drawn from Treasury.\n3For information on how these ratios are calculated and what they represent, see endnote 17 of ourQ4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Supplement.\n4U.S. G-SIB banks refers to United States global systemically important banks, as defined by the Financial Stability Board.

We play an essential role in the U.S. economy, especially during tough economic times, by helping to ensure a stable source of funding to offer home mortgages, in all markets and in all business cycles. This report is largely dedicated to describing the residential needs of low- and moderate-income families. In 2024, low- and moderate-income families faced challenges in the housing market, including a high-interest rate environment, elevated housing prices, and an ongoing shortage of affordable homes for purchase or rent. Despite these challenges, Fannie Mae has been able to provide a reliable source of liquidity to the housing market, help improve housing affordability, and support homeowner and renter stability at every stage of the housing journey.\nRead the AHARRead the AMR\nAs required by Fannie Mae’s Charter Act and implementing regulations, the company submits its Annual Housing Activities Report (“AHAR”) and Annual Mortgage Report (“AMR”).\nThe AHAR and AMR reflect housing activities undertaken by Fannie Mae and the company’s performance against our housing goals established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”).\nThe AHAR and AMR include data tables that provide information about each goal and our performance under each goal and subgoal.

The HPSI reflects consumers’ current views and forward-looking expectations of housing market conditions and complements existing data sources to inform housing-related analysis and decision-making. The HPSI is constructed from answers to six NHS questions that solicit consumers’ evaluations of housing market conditions and address topics that are related to their home purchase decisions. The questions ask consumers whether they think that it is a good or bad time to buy or to sell a house, what direction they expect home prices and mortgage interest rates to move, how concerned they are about losing their jobs, and whether their incomes are higher or lower than they were a year earlier.\nOn the right rail of this webpage, you will find the latest Data Release highlighting the consumer attitudinal indicators, month-over-month key indicator data, an overview and white paper about the HPSI, technical notes providing in-depth information about the National Housing Survey methodology, the questionnaire used for the survey, and a comparative assessment of Fannie Mae’s National Housing Survey and other consumer surveys.\nNational Housing Survey Monthly Indicators ArchiveClickherefor an archived list of Fannie Mae's National Housing Survey Monthly Indicators.\nOpinions, analyses, estimates, forecasts, beliefs, and other views of Fannie Mae's Economic and Strategic Research (ESR) Group or survey respondents included in these materials should not be construed as indicating Fannie Mae's business prospects or expected results, are based on a number of assumptions, and are subject to change without notice.

Using insurance claims to proxy for damages we find that both short-term delinquency and forbearance take-up are positively associated with damages. Loan modification is positively correlated with damages of up to 50 percent of property value and negatively correlated thereafter, suggesting that, for severely damaged homes with flood insurance, loan modifications are not an attractive remedy for delinquency concerns.Read more»\nMultifamily Investors Expected to Stay Focused on South Florida Despite Climate Challenges\nMay 7, 2024\nDespite climate-related challenges, as well as other external factors, including elevated interest rates, higher construction costs, and sky-rocketing property insurance premiums, both residents and real estate investors have a positive longer-term outlook on the southeastern region of the Sunshine State, especially for the multifamily sector.Read more»\nThe Impact of 2019 Changes to Texas' Flood Disclosure Requirements on House Prices\nFebruary 21, 2024\nThis paper examines the impact of a 2019 change to Texas' real estate disclosure law that introduced requirements to disclose when a property is in a moderate risk flood zone and increased the prominence of all flood-related disclosures.Read more»\nThe Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program: A Comprehensive Review\nJanuary 23, 2024\nThis review explores literature assessing the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program.

Making a good loan choice is not easy. The typical borrower faces a dozen or more individual cash charges and an interest rate that will determine the amount of the loan payments. The mortgage market is a negotiated market, prices are not fixed. The borrower’s inexperience versus the skill and experience of lenders, realtors, and title and settlement agents gives a negotiating advantage to better-informed side. Some borrowers end up with good deals, and some with not-so-good. This paper studies how the cost of a mortgage varies with loan and borrower characteristics, such as loan amount, borrower race, credit score, borrower income and education, geography, type of lender, whether the borrower was a first-time homebuyer, and more.Read more»\nNext to Kin: How Children Influence the Housing and Mobility Decisions of Older Adults\nJune 1, 2022\nThis Fannie Mae working paper explores the residential mobility of older adults, with a focus on the influence of distance to children on those decisions.Read more»\nMortgage costs as a share of housing costs—placing the cost of credit in broader context\nMarch 9, 2022\nFannie Mae’s latest working paper focuses on the different components of housing costs to show the contribution of each expense to overall housing costs, specifically focusing on a breakdown of mortgage costs.Read more»\nAppraising the Appraisal\nJanuary 20, 2022\nFannie Mae's latest research evaluates appraisal values of homes owned by Black and white borrowers refinancing their homes.Read more»\nBarriers to Entry: Closing Costs for First-Time and Low-Income Homebuyers\nDecember 2, 2021\nFannie Mae's latest research on affordable housing solutions shows that closing costs are a meaningful obstacle to sustainable homeownership for first-time and low-income first-time homebuyers, including Black and Hispanic borrowers.Read more»\nSolar at High Noon: Solar Home Premiums in a Rapidly Maturing Market\nJuly 2, 2021\nIn this Fannie Mae working paper, we explore how current premiums have changed over time, particularly in relation to changes in solar replacement costs and energy savings.Read more»\nSeeking Alpha in the Housing Market\nJune 15, 2021\nThis Fannie Mae working paper examined short term trades in the housing market over the period 2000–2013 using nationally representative data across multiple U.S. housing markets.Read more»\nAdverse Selection and Climate Risk\nMarch 30, 2021\nThis Fannie Mae working paper investigated the 2019 findings of Ouazad and Kahn and found no evidence that mortgage lenders change their loan origination, approval, and securitization practices in areas affected by major hurricanes.Read more»\nDensity Control, Home Price Appreciation, and Rental Growth in the United States\nDecember 23, 2020\nThis Fannie Mae working paper investigates density control in the top 50 U.S. metropolitan areas using National Longitudinal Land Use Survey (NLLUS) data from 1994, 2003, and 2019.Read more»\nWhen Appraisers Go Low, Contracts Go Lower: The Impact of Expert Opinions on Transaction Prices\nOctober 8, 2020\nUsing home purchase loan application data, this Fannie Mae working papers studies buyer responses to the uncommon occurrence of the appraised value coming in below the contract price (i.e. a low appraisal), which sharply raises the probability of downward price renegotiation.Read more»\nImpediments to Post-Great Recession Recovery of Homeowner Mobility\nSeptember 1, 2020\nThis paper introduces a novel data set of Fannie Mae proprietary loan and market transaction observations to document the current experience and historical context of homeowner mobility.

Although mortgage demand has since cooled due to higher interest rates, the rise in remote work has increased households' willingness to commute farther or even relocate to a different region.Read more»\nFannie Mae Updates Demographic Projections\nAugust 2, 2024\nWe provide an overview of the methodology and our outlook regarding projected growth in total households, owner households, and renter households over the 2023-2032 time period.

To gain a more holistic sense of their financial situations, we also asked consumers questions about their non-housing finances, including debt levels and their perceived financial resilience.Read more»\nFannie Mae Now Collects First-of-Its-Kind LGBT Data Through National Housing Survey\nJune 20, 2024\nWith the introduction of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) identifiers in the National Housing Survey® (NHS), Fannie Mae can now survey consumers who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) regarding their attitudes, intentions, and financial circumstances that pertain to housing and mortgage markets. In this first report, we analyzed data collected in 2023.Read more»\nFinancial Benefits Motivated Homebuying During the Pandemic, More So Than Space or Location Preferences\nJanuary 11, 2023\nSingle-family housing was an unintended beneficiary of the pandemic and its associated policy response. During the pandemic, mortgage rates reached historically low levels, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate hovering around 3% though the end of 2021. Despite a low inventory-to-sales ratio during this time period by historical standards, as well as rising home prices, both home sales and purchase mortgage originations reached record highs in 2021. Anecdotal and analytical evidence suggest that the pandemic prompted people to move from smaller housing units in high-density city centers to larger homes in lower-density areas; and this was particularly true of first-time homebuyers. Our researchers studied this phenomenon, and our survey findings illustrate the primacy of financial considerations over the benefits of physical space and location in influencing homebuying behavior during the pandemic.Read more»\nThe U.S. Housing Shortage from a Local Perspective\nOctober 28, 2022\nIn this report, Fannie Mae economists examine the contours of housing supply for 75 major U.S. metropolitan markets in a way that might offer clues to addressing the housing supply crisis at the local level.Read more»\nHousing Poised to Become Strong Driver of Inflation\nJune 9, 2021\nDespite rapid house price appreciation, due to the way shelter costs are measured, housing has actually helped hold back the recent surge in in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from moving even higher. However, that is soon likely to change as strong house price gains flow into common price measures, likely contributing to an elevated rate of overall inflation through at least 2022.Read more»\nCOVID-19 Led First-Time Homebuyers to Move Away from Highly Dense City Centers\nMarch 30, 2021\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the country in 2020, it touched nearly every aspect of the U.S. economy.

The analyses and other views in these materials represent the views of the author(s) as of the date indicated and do not necessarily represent the views of Fannie Mae's Economic & Strategic Research Group, Fannie Mae or its management.\nDo New Housing Units Next Door Raise Your Rents?\nSeptember 1, 2020\nHousehold income has not kept pace with housing demand in recent years and housing costs as a share of income is a key concern for many households. The potential of increasing housing supply to help ease housing cost burdens is not well understood empirically, and it is debated whether creation of new housing units would help, or hurt, nearby residents. While new development could provide needed relief to unmet housing demand in the local market, and thus reduce local housing costs, it could attract high-income residents and new amenities to a neighborhood, driving up prices and leading to gentrification and displacement. Studies looking to untangle these competing effects often struggle to find adequate data on rents over time at the local level. In recent research sponsored by Fannie Mae’s Economic & Strategic Research Group, NYU Furman Center Doctoral Fellow Xiaodi Li uses unique data on housing construction, rents, and prices in New York City, coupled with a thoughtful research design, to tackle these challenges.Read more»\nMortgage Journeys: A Video Ethnography of the Homebuying and Mortgage Process\nApril 25, 2019\nIn March, Abt Associates Inc., a public policy research firm, published a research paper that presented findings about the mortgage shopping experiences of lower-income, first-time homebuyers. Fannie Mae commissioned the video ethnography study, and Mark Palim, Vice President and Deputy Chief Economist, authored aPerspectives blogbased on its findings. Overall, the research illuminated the need to improve the ease of mortgage shopping for this cohort of homebuyers at all stages of the homebuying process.Read more»|Read the Perspectives blog»\nLow Income Homeownership and the Role of State Affordable Mortgage Programs\nMay 17, 2018\nEnabling access to affordable and sustainable homeownership has long been a goal of U.S. housing policy and is central to Fannie Mae's mission. A critical part of achieving this mission is to support programs and lenders that extend homeownership sustainably – that is, providing mortgages to lower income households who are able to maintain their mortgage payments over time. Affordable lending programs administered through state Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) provide a potential vehicle for realizing this goal, but there are few empirical analyses of HFA originated mortgages. In their recent working paper, professors from The Ohio State University, San Jose State University, and the University of Chicago use data on first-time homebuyer mortgages securitized by Fannie Mae between 2005 and 2014 to estimate the impact of HFA originations on loan performance.Read more»\nCohort Transitions and Age Group Analysis of Millennial Homeownership Demand: Understanding Trajectories of Recovery Following the Great Recession\nMay 9, 2018\nHow we perceive Millennial homeownership trends is influenced directly by the choice of method for measuring change. Whereas the traditional \"age-group\" approach suggests that Millennial homeownership demand remains in a recession-induced stupor, the more dynamic \"cohort\" perspective indicates that young-adult demand has begun to rebound along with the economy. But how do these two radically different views on Millennial homeownership comport with data on young-adult home buying activity? New research from the University of Southern California and Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, in partnership with Fannie Mae, shows that the age-group approach produces a lagging view of Millennial homeownership demand that does not correspond with current market data on home purchases, whereas the cohort approach offers a consistent contemporaneous perspective.Read more»\nSimulation of Young-Adult Homeownership Change through 2035: Effects of Growing Diversity and Rising Educational Attainment\nJune 20, 2017\nIn the latest and final installment of a working paper series on young-adult homeownership, University of Southern California researchers simulate how future changes in the characteristics of young adults might affect changes in their homeownership rate. The analysis estimates prospective changes between 2015 and 2035 in the prevalence of homeownership among young adults aged 25 to 44, prime ages for first-time homebuying. The simulations place special emphasis on how increases in racial and ethnic diversity and alternative scenarios for future college educational attainment might alter the trajectory of young-adult homeownership.Read more»\nThe Shifting Determinants of Young-Adult Homeownership Before and After the Great Recession\nMarch 30, 2017\nIn the most recent report from their ongoing study of young-adult homeownership, University of Southern California researchers explore the effects of young adults' race, education, income, and wealth on their homeownership attainment in the pre- and post-recession periods, independent of the socioeconomic status of their parents.Read more»\nSeniors' Access to Home Equity: Identifying Existing Mechanisms and Impediments to Broader Adoption\nFebruary 28, 2017\nWhy are older homeowners so reluctant to draw on housing wealth to help secure a more comfortable retirement? In the second of a series of studies on seniors and home equity sponsored by Fannie Mae and conducted by the Urban Institute, Karan Kaul and Laurie Goodman begin to explore this conundrum. The new working paper describes the various mechanisms that seniors could use to access home equity, identifies impediments keeping them from extracting equity, and offers recommendations for overcoming these obstacles.Read more»\nStarting to Understand the Potential Role of Home Equity in Enhancing Retirement Security\nNovember 1, 2016\nIn the first of a series of studies sponsored by Fannie Mae, the Urban Institute examines the potential role of home equity in improving retirement security.Read more»\nEducation and the Intergenerational Transmission of Homeownership\nSeptember 14, 2016In a new study sponsored by Fannie Mae, researchers from the University of Southern California unpack the complex linkages between educational attainment and homeownership attainment. As parents play a role both in supporting their children’s education and in helping them buy homes, the authors examine the importance of parental background compared with individual resources (including education) in the achievement of homeownership. Overall, the findings suggest that parental background has a strong effect on children’s chances for both higher education and homeownership, but education maintains an independent effect on homeownership attainment that could help reduce disparities in access.Learn More»\nParental Financial Assistance and Young-Adult Homeownership\nApril 26, 2016In this study, researchers from the University of Southern California examine the prevalence of parental financial assistance and its effect on young-adult transitions into homeownership.

    "text": "In the early years of the 20th century, homeownership was a cherished dream for many families. Yet without the long-term, fixed rate mortgage most homeowners have today, saving for a down payment was tough, loans were short-term, and large balloon payments awaited when those notes came due.\nDuring the Great Depression, nearly a quarter of the nation’s homeowners lost their homes to foreclosure. Banks simply didn’t have the funds to make mortgage loans. To address the situation, the United States government created Fannie Mae and charged it with the mission it continues to serve today: to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability in the mortgage market.\nFannie Mae helped banks finance a new type of mortgage: the long-term, fixed-rate home loan. The innovative mortgage loan expanded access to affordable homeownership, offered homeowners more certainty about their monthly mortgage payments, and transformed the housing industry.\nAt Fannie Mae, we continue our mission to help make stable, efficient, and affordable mortgage loans available in the United States. We strive to be America’s most valued housing partner by maintaining responsible risk management for sustainable housing finance and leading with innovative mortgage solutions.\nDuring the Great Depression, there was a recognized need for a reliable, steady source of funding for housing. At the time, affordable mortgage credit was inaccessible for many families.\nFannie Mae financed home purchases for millions of American soldiers returning from World War II. The nation’s economy grew rapidly and the liquidity Fannie Mae provided allowed mortgage lenders to have the cash on hand to meet the demand.\nHomeownership grew throughout the country during the second half of the 20th century and fueled the rise of the middle class. The Charter Act reorganized Fannie Mae from a government agency into a mixed ownership corporation in 1954.\nIn the 1968 Housing and Urban Development Act, Fannie Mae became a private shareholder-owned corporation chartered by the U.S. Congress. After being removed from the federal budget, Fannie Mae funded its operations through stock and bond markets.\nIn the 1980s, the development of mortgage-backed securities brought capital from global markets to the U.S. housing industry. Fannie Mae securitized mortgage loans and guaranteed payment to investors, which it continues to do today.\nHousing prices plummeted and delinquencies rose during the financial crisis, and the government-sponsored enterprises lost billions of dollars on investment portfolios and mortgage-backed security guarantees. The federal government put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nThe company returned to profitability in 2012.  In 2014, Fannie Mae had paid back all funds it received when it first went under conservatorship and has since put billions into the U.S. Treasury."

    "text": "While our role providing liquidity and stability to the residential mortgage market and promoting affordable access to mortgage credit has remained constant, we’ve strengthened our business model significantly since entering conservatorship. This makes us better able to withstand market fluctuations and respond to risk. And we’re better prepared to serve homebuyers and renters in good times and tough times.\nPreviously, we earned most of our revenue by holding a large investment portfolio of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Today, we have drastically reduced our portfolio and shifted to a more stable, guaranty fee-driven business model. Our model is focused on receiving a steady stream of monthly fees to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on the mortgage-backed securities we sell to American and global investors.\nAs we’ve transitioned our business model, we’ve achieved 13 straight years of annual profitability. We’ve now paid approximately $181 billion to the Treasury in senior preferred stock dividends, which is about $62 billion more than we have received in support from the government since 2008. And in just the past 5 years, when we’ve been permitted to retain our earnings, we’ve increased our net worth by over $81 billion, resulting in nearly $95 billion of net worth as of the end of 2024.\nWe provide financing every day to help strengthen the housing market, which contributes to the economy, job growth, and a better quality of life across America. Our role is even more critical in tough moments for the economy. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many other financial institutions held back their mortgage purchases, which would have prevented many people from securing a mortgage or refinancing. Fannie Mae stepped in and provided additional support, increasing our mortgage purchases to ensure a strong housing market and help the economy.\nAt the same time, we developed innovative and flexible tools for mortgage companies to help renters and homeowners impacted by the pandemic. For homeowners facing financial hardships, we offered the option to suspend or delay mortgage payments up to 18 months. We helped more than 1.4 million homeowners under this plan.\nFannie Mae stepped in during the pandemic to support access to homeownership\nTo help ensure we are able to meet the housing market’s needs in times of stress, the U.S. government has established rigorous bank-like capital requirements that we will be required to meet to allow us to operate during difficult economic periods. We are building our capital reserves to meet these requirements.\nAt the same time, since entering conservatorship, we’ve focused on improving the resilience and credit quality of the book of mortgages we guarantee. This greater resilience is shown in the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (known as DFAST) our regulator mandates that we conduct to assess our ability to withstand difficult economic conditions. Over the past few years, our DFAST results have shown limited or no pre-tax losses during severe economic downturn scenarios that were far worse than the 2008 financial crisis. This underscores the strength of our business and its ability to serve as a source of stability in the market today and in the future.\n12017 GAAP net income includes a $9.9B provision for federal income taxes resulting from the remeasurement of Fannie Mae’s deferred tax assets due to the corporate tax reduction in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n2Dividend payments do not reduce the senior preferred stock’s liquidation preference, which includes cumulative amounts drawn from Treasury.\n3For information on how these ratios are calculated and what they represent, see endnote 17 of ourQ4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Supplement.\n4U.S. G-SIB banks refers to United States global systemically important banks, as defined by the Financial Stability Board. U.S. G-SIB banks capital metrics represent the average of those banks’ capital requirements post-2024 stress test as outlined by the Federal Reserve. For additional information, see endnote 19 of ourQ4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Supplement.\nAll charts reflect data through the end of 2024 unless otherwise noted.\nPage last revised: 2/28/25"

Including subsequent \ndata may lead to materially different results. Home price growth rate is not seasonally adjusted. UPB estimates are based on data available through the end of December 2024, and \nthe top 10 states are reported by UPB in descending order. One-year home price growth rate is for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2024.\n (8) Single-family conventional loan population consists of: (a) single-family conventional mortgage loans of Fannie Mae and (b) single-family conventional mortgage loans underlying \nFannie Mae MBS other than loans underlying Freddie Mac securities that Fannie Mae has resecuritized. It excludes non-Fannie Mae single-family mortgage-related securities held in \nthe retained mortgage portfolio for which Fannie Mae does not provide a guaranty. Conventional refers to mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities that are not guaranteed or \ninsured, in whole or in part, by the U.S. government or one of its agencies.\n (9) The multifamily guaranty book of business consists of: (a) multifamily mortgage loans of Fannie Mae; (b) multifamily mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS; and (c) other credit \nenhancements that the company provided on multifamily mortgage assets. It excludes non-Fannie Mae multifamily mortgage-related securities held in the retained mortgage portfolio \nfor which Fannie Mae does not provide a guaranty. \n (10) Includes mortgage pool insurance transactions.\n (11) Base guaranty fee income, net of TCCA, is interest income from the guaranty book of business excluding the impact of a 10 basis point guaranty fee increase implemented in 2012 \npursuant to the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 and as extended by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the incremental revenue from which is paid to \nTreasury and not retained by the company. \n (12) \"Deferred guaranty fee income\" refers to income primarily from the upfront fees that the company receives at the time of loan acquisition related to single-family loan-level price \nadjustments or other fees the company receives from lenders, which are amortized over the contractual life of the loan. Deferred guaranty fee income also includes the amortization of \ncost basis adjustments on mortgage loans and debt of consolidated trusts that are not associated with upfront fees.\n (13) Net interest income from portfolios consists of: interest income from assets held in the company's retained mortgage portfolio and corporate liquidity portfolio; interest income from \nother assets used to support lender liquidity; and interest expense on the company's outstanding corporate debt and Connecticut Avenue Securities® debt. For purposes of this \nFinancial Supplement chart, income (expense) from hedge accounting is included in the \"net interest income from portfolios & hedge impact\" category; however, the company does \nnot consider income (expense) from hedge accounting to be a component of net interest income from portfolios. The company had $840 million in hedge accounting expense in 2024.\n2024 Financial Supplement   27\n© 2025 Fannie Mae\nDRAFT\nEndnotes \n (14) Retained mortgage portfolio refers to the mortgage-related assets the company owns (excluding the portion of assets that back mortgage-related securities owned by third parties). \nWe classify our retained  mortgage portfolio into three categories: lender liquidity, loss mitigation and other, which categories are described in the company's 2024 Form 10-K.\n (15) Outstanding debt balance consists of the unpaid principal balance, premiums and discounts, fair value adjustments, hedge-related basis adjustments and other cost basis \nadjustments.\n (16) Cash equivalents are composed of overnight reverse repurchase agreements and U.S. Treasuries that have a maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or less.\n (17) Fannie Mae information is as of 12/31/2024. U.S. G-SIB Banks represent the applicable capital requirements that are effective October 2024. Ratios are calculated as a percentage of \nrisk-weighted assets for risk-based capital metrics and as a percentage of adjusted total assets for leverage capital metrics. The U.S. G-SIB Banks leverage ratio represents the \nminimum regulatory tier 1 leverage ratio. Fannie Mae tier 1 leverage ratio includes capital buffers. Tier 1 leverage ratio under the enterprise regulatory capital framework is calculated \nas required tier 1 capital divided by adjusted total assets.\n (18) While the company is in conservatorship, the company is not required to comply with the minimum capital or buffer requirements.\n (19) U.S. G-SIB Banks refers to United States global systemically important banks, as defined by the Financial Stability Board, which as of November 2024 consisted of Bank of America \nCorp., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, State Street Corp., and Wells Fargo & Co. U.S. G-SIB \nBank capital metrics represent the average of those banks capital requirements post-2024 stress test as outlined by the Federal Reserve. See https://www.federalreserve.gov/\npublications/files/large-bank-capital-requirements-20240828.pdf\n (20) CET1 requirement as presented represents our average CET1 capital requirement under the enterprise regulatory capital framework for the applicable periods (which is not currently \nin effect while we are in conservatorship) and not the amount of our actual average CET1 capital for the reported periods. Average required CET1 for 2022 represents the average of \nthe Q1 2022 and Q4 2022 required CET1 as reported in our Form 10-Q and 10-K.\n (21) Fannie Mae information is as of 12/31/2024. U.S. G-SIB Banks represent the applicable capital requirements that are effective October 2024.\n (22) Net worth is also reported as stockholders' equity on our GAAP financial statements.\n (23) Stated value of the senior preferred stock was $120.8 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n (24) The $37 billion of available regulatory capital the company built in the last two years consists of the sum of: net income we earned and the amount by which our deferred tax asset \nchanged.\n (25) The enterprise regulatory capital framework became effective on January 1, 2022, and has a transition period for compliance, as described in the company's 2024 Form 10-K.\n (26) Minimum capital requirement does not include buffers.\n2024 Financial Supplement   28\n© 2025 Fannie Mae\nDRAFT\nEndnotes \n (27) Represents, on an annualized basis, the sum of the base guaranty fees charged during the period for the company's single-family conventional guaranty arrangements plus the \nrecognition of any upfront cash payments relating to these guaranty arrangements based on an estimated average life at the time of acquisition. Excludes the impact of a 10 basis \npoint guaranty fee increase implemented pursuant to the TCCA, the incremental revenue from which is paid to Treasury and not retained by the company.\n (28) FICO credit score is as of loan origination, as reported by the seller of the mortgage loan.\n (29) Excludes loans for which this information is not readily available. From time to time, the company revises its guidelines for determining a borrower's DTI ratio. The amount of income \nreported by a borrower and used to qualify for a mortgage may not represent the borrower's total income; therefore, the DTI ratios reported may be higher than borrowers' actual DTI \nratios.\n (30) Refers to HomeReady® mortgage loans, a low down payment mortgage product offered by the company that is designed for creditworthy low-income borrowers. HomeReady allows \nup to 97% loan-to-value ratio financing for home purchases. The company offers additional low down payment mortgage products that are not HomeReady loans; therefore, this \ncategory is not representative of all high LTV ratio single-family loans acquired or in the single-family conventional guaranty book of business for the periods shown. See the \"OLTV \nRatio > 95%\" category for information on the single-family loans acquired or in the single-family conventional guaranty book of business with origination LTV ratios greater than 95%.\n (31) Calculated based on the aggregate unpaid principal balance of single-family loans for each category divided by the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans in the single-family \nconventional guaranty book of business. Loans with multiple product features are included in all applicable categories.\n (32) Percentage of loans in the single-family conventional guaranty book of business, measured by unpaid principal balance, included in an agreement used to reduce credit risk by \nrequiring collateral, letters of credit, mortgage insurance, corporate guarantees, inclusion in a credit risk transfer transaction reference pool, or other agreement that provides for \nFannie Mae's compensation to some degree in the event of a financial loss relating to the loan.\n (33) Single-family SDQ rate refers to single-family loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the foreclosure process, expressed as a percentage of the company’s single-family \nconventional guaranty book of business, based on loan count.

Excludes loans for which this information is not readily available.\n (36) Refers to loans included in an agreement used to reduce credit risk by requiring primary mortgage insurance, collateral, letters of credit, corporate guarantees, or other agreements to \nprovide an entity with some assurance that it will be compensated to some degree in the event of a financial loss. Excludes loans covered by credit risk transfer transactions unless \nsuch loans are also covered by primary mortgage insurance.\n (37) Outstanding unpaid principal balance represents the underlying loan balance, which is different from the reference pool balance for CAS and some lender risk-sharing transactions. \n (38) Based on the unpaid principal balance of the single-family conventional guaranty book of business as of period end.\n (39) Measured from the borrowers' last paid installment on their mortgages to when the related properties were added to the company's REO inventory for foreclosures completed during \nthe twelve months ended December 31, 2024. Home Equity Conversion Mortgages insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development are excluded from this calculation.\n2024 Financial Supplement   29\n© 2025 Fannie Mae\nDRAFT\nEndnotes \n (40) This chart does not include loans in an active forbearance arrangement, trial modifications, and repayment plans that have been initiated but not completed. There were approximately \n19,300 loans in a trial modification period that was not complete as of December 31, 2024.\n (41) Includes repayment plans and foreclosure alternatives. Repayment plans reflect only those plans associated with loans that were 60 days or more delinquent. \n (42) Defaults include loan foreclosures, short sales, sales to third parties at the time of foreclosure and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. Cumulative Default Rate is the total number of single-\nfamily conventional loans in the guaranty book of business originated in the identified year that have defaulted, divided by the total number of single-family conventional loans in the \nguaranty book of business originated in the identified year. Data as of December 31, 2024 is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate performance of the loans and performance may \nchange, perhaps materially, in future periods.\n (43) Represents the percentage of loans with lender risk-sharing agreements in place, measured by unpaid principal balance.\n (44) Under the Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (\"DUS\") program, Fannie Mae acquires individual, newly originated mortgages from specially approved DUS lenders using DUS \nunderwriting standards and/or DUS loan documents. Because DUS lenders generally share the risk of loss with Fannie Mae, they are able to originate, underwrite, close and service \nmost loans without a pre-review by the company.\n (45) Includes any loan that was underwritten with an interest-only term less than the term of the loan, regardless of whether it is currently in its interest-only period.\n (46) Estimates of current DSCRs are based on the latest available income information covering a 12 month period, from quarterly and annual statements for these properties including the \nrelated debt service. When an annual statement is the latest statement available, it is used. When operating statement information is not available, the underwritten DSCR is used. \nCo-op loans are excluded from this metric.\n (47) Small balance loans refer to multifamily loans with an original unpaid principal balance of up to $9 million. Small balance loans are included within the asset class categories \nreferenced above. We present this metric in the table based on loan count rather than unpaid principal balance. Small balance loans comprised 10%, 11% and 11% of our multifamily \nguaranty book of business as of December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, based on unpaid principal balance of the loan.\n (48) Multifamily serious delinquency rate refers to multifamily loans that are 60 days or more past due, expressed as a percentage of the company’s multifamily guaranty book of business, \nbased on unpaid principal balance. Multifamily serious delinquency rate for loans in a particular category (such as acquisition year, asset class or targeted affordable segment), refers \nto seriously delinquent loans in the applicable category, divided by the unpaid principal balance of the loans in the multifamily guaranty book of business in that category.\n (49) Criticized loans represent loans classified as \"Special Mention,\" \"Substandard\" or \"Doubtful.\" Loans classified as \"Special Mention\" refers to loans that are otherwise performing but \nhave potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration in the borrower’s ability to repay in full. Loans classified as \"Substandard\" have a well-defined weakness \nthat jeopardizes the timely full repayment. \"Doubtful\" refers to a loan with a weakness that makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable based on existing \nconditions and values. \n (50) See https://multifamily.fanniemae.com/financing-options for definitions. Loans with multiple product features are included in all applicable categories.\n (51) Represents Multifamily Affordable Housing loans, which are defined as financing for properties that are under an agreement that provides long-term affordability, such as properties \nwith rent subsidies or income restrictions.\n (52) Cumulative net credit loss rate is the cumulative net credit losses through December 31, 2024 on the multifamily loans that were acquired in the applicable period, as a percentage of \nthe total acquired unpaid principal balance of multifamily loans that were acquired in the applicable period. Net credit losses include expected benefit of freestanding loss-sharing \narrangements, primarily multifamily DUS lender risk-sharing transactions. Credit loss rate for 2014 acquisitions was primarily driven by the write-off of a seniors housing portfolio in Q1 \n2023.\n2024 Financial Supplement   30\n© 2025 Fannie Mae\nDRAFT\nEndnotes \n (53) Consists of the company's allowance for loan losses, allowance for accrued interest receivable and reserve for guaranty losses.\n (54) Calculated based on single-family conventional guaranty book of business.\n (55) Our multifamily credit loss reserves exclude the expected benefit of freestanding credit enhancements on multifamily loans, which are recorded in \"Other assets\" in our consolidated \nbalance sheets.\n (56) Calculated based on net income for the reporting period divided by average total assets during the period, expressed as a percentage. Average balances for purposes of ratio \ncalculations is based on quarter-end balances.\n (57) Efficiency ratio is calculated as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income. As presented in the Selected Financial Data slide of this \nFinancial Supplement, non-interest income consists of the sum of “Fee and other income,” “Investment gains (losses), net” and “Fair value gains (losses), net.”"

    "text": "If you operate a community land trust, below market rate program, or another program that uses income and resale price restrictions (deed restrictions) to create long-term affordability, certifying your program can help you offer your homebuyers more financing opportunities and save your lending partners time.\nFannie Mae's Shared Equity Program Platform allows you to quickly and easily show that you meet conventional financing requirements in as little as 10 minutes, expanding your customers' borrowing options.\nFannie Mae works with lenders to make financing more available to homebuyers purchasing from a shared equity program. In return, lenders confirm that programs they work with meet certain industry standards and program requirements. By answering a few simple questions, you can let lenders know that you meet those standards, opening up new opportunities for your homebuyers to finance their mortgage.\nTo complete the application you'll be asked to provide:\nOnce submitted, your application will be reviewed and you will be notified of the results. Assuming your program meets the necessary requirements, the program will be added to theCertified Shared Equity Programs List.\nGet started\nIf your program, for example, uses both a ground lease and also a deed restriction you’ll want to add both legal documents for review. Once you’ve completed the application for your first program (ground lease), you’ll have the option to add the additional legal document (deed restriction). Your contact information will appear and you’ll be able to edit any information, but you’ll need to continue through the same questions ensuring they’re accurate for the new legal document as details such as the term of the resale restrictions may be different. Please be aware that you will need to complete your submission in one sitting. Applications that have not been submitted will not be saved and you will be unable to return to an incomplete application at a later time.\nAs a best practice, if you don’t have all of your documents and information available when you initially complete the application, you may find it easier to complete the application for your ground lease and submit that application and then start a new application for the deed restriction document with a different application.\nYes, if you did not complete the form and submit your information, you will need to start the application form again.\nCheck that your browser is updated to the latest version. We also recommend using a browser other than Microsoft Edge, if possible.\nIf you still need help, reach out to[email protected].\nPlease contact[email protected]for assistance.\nIf your legal agreement between the program and homeowners (often a ground lease or deed restriction) is finalized, you can submit the application. There is no requirement to have existing units when you apply. If your program is certified, you will be responsible for providing updated documents if and when they change.\nWe ask this question to understand whether the organization listed in your initial contact information is the same as the organization named in the legal agreement between the homeowner and the program. This question does not seek to understand if your funder(s) are named within your legal documents—only whether the legal agreement is signed by the homeowner and your organization, or a different organization. This may be the case if a nonprofit organization is paid to administer, steward, or provide monitoring and compliance for a municipal or other nonprofit’s portfolio of affordable homeownership units."

    "text": "1 \nCan Service-Learning Programs at Anchor Institutions Contribute \nto Increasing Homebuyer Readiness through Financial Capability? \nKevin Giff, BA \nHabitat for Humanity of Orange County, NC \nSusan Kasteler, BS \nThe University of Alabama \nNicole B. Prewitt, EdD (contact author) \nThe University of Alabama \nnbprewitt@ua.edu \nLydia Stanley, MS \nThe University of Alabama \nDecember 14, 2020 \nAbstract \nWe used the case study model including survey methods to assess the level of consumer \nfinancial capability among low- to moderate-income (LMI) individuals and families seeking \nfirst-time homeownership through a student-led service-learning program. In addition to \nassessing understanding of key elements of consumer homebuyer readiness (including savings, \nmoney management, access to banking, credit building, and debt reduction) we also gauged \noverall sentiment regarding the path to homeownership. Results show the capability of service-\nlearning programs at anchor institutions to deliver a financial coaching program. In future work, \nthere is interest in exploring opportunities to expand the program in underserved and rural \nmarkets and focus on manufactured and affordable housing to promote the mission of Duty to \nServe (DTS) to overcome significant challenges that impact LMI families’ ability to secure and \nsustain homeownership. \n2 \nIntroduction \nFirst-time homeownership remains inaccessible for many Americans, particularly for \nthose from low- to moderate-income households (LMI) (U.S Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD), 2020). Homeownership is a pathway to building wealth, developing \nthriving neighborhoods, and creating sustainable communities. Potential impediments that \nindividuals face include stagnant wages, low savings, and high living expenses combined with \nlimited access to the mainstream financial system. Additionally, many individuals have limited \nawareness of community programs that aim to build financial literacy for first-time homebuyers. \nWhen individuals seek support there are some organizations with restricted funds and/or \nmisaligned resources.  These elements create an environment where LMI individuals and \nfamilies are less likely to benefit from social and economic opportunities. The disconnect \nbetween financial capability and homebuyer readiness outlines the need for anchor institutions to \npartner with their community to create a sustainable program that educates individuals of the \nsteps to homeownership so this dream can become a reality for all who desire it. \nOwning a home is the primary vehicle for building long-term wealth. Homeownership \ncontributes to improved health, child development, educational attainment, employment \nopportunities, greater community stability, and higher life satisfaction (Herbert & Belsky, 2008; \nKane, 1994; Pollack, Griffin, & Lynch, 2010; Rohe & Lindbald, 2013; Shanks, 2007). Despite \nthe importance of homeownership for long-term economic freedom, homeownership rates are at \nhistoric lows, particularly among LMI households and households of color. For example, in \nAlabama white homeownership surpasses homeownership by individuals of color by 150 percent \n(Prosperity Now, 2017). Similarly, the homeownership rate for households with very low \nincomes is more than forty percent lower than the rate for high-income households (U.S. \n3 \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 2012).  \nAlthough the economy and housing market are improving nationwide, Alabama lags \nbehind the rest of the country in homeownership. Alabama is the fifth poorest state in the United \nStates, with 16.8 percent of the state living below the federal poverty line (noticeably higher than \nthe national average of 13.1 percent). This equates to nearly 800,000 Alabamians living in \npoverty (Alabama Possible, 2020). Looking beyond monthly paychecks and observing what a \nfamily owns is even more startling. One in five Alabamians live in asset poverty, “meaning they \ndo not have enough resources (i.e., net worth) to subsist at the federal poverty level for three \nmonths if their income were interrupted.” (Prosperity Now, 2020). These staggering disparities \ndepict the obstacles that inhibit economic mobility for many Alabamians. \nTo better understand these issues, The University of Alabama (UA), an anchor institution \n(Dubb, McKinley and Howard, 2013) driven by its public service mission, developed HomeFirst, \na service-learning program and training curriculum that provides financial coaching, \nindividualized support, and program referrals to low- to moderate-income individuals and \nfamilies seeking first-time homeownership. The HomeFirst program seeks to convene Alabama \nresidents, undergraduate college students, and community partners across the state to ensure \nevery resident of Alabama has a decent, safe, and affordable place to call home. The primary \nobjectives include: 1) executing effective best practices to reduce barriers that prevent low- to \nmoderate-income individuals and families from building assets and attaining homeownership, 2) \nutilizing a primarily undergraduate student volunteer base to deliver financial coaching services, \nand 3) promoting collaboration and effective resource building by coordination among \nnonprofits, local government entities, and The University of Alabama.  \nHomeFirst supports each participant’s path toward homeownership by focusing on core \n4 \n \nareas related to homebuyer readiness through financial capability, including savings, money \nmanagement, access to banking, credit building, and debt reduction. HomeFirst uses a \nparticipant-driven process in which participants work through modules to improve their financial \ncapability by focusing on specific, personalized goals. Student coaches do not offer financial \nadvice on their participant’s financial issues, but rather they serve as module guides and provide \ntools, resources, and motivation to participants as they work toward their goals. The modules \nprovide the roadmap for each participant’s path toward homeownership, with each module being \nstructured to provide a brief overview of important financial topics while allowing the participant \nto apply the skills to their own lives through a short activity and action plan. Modules also \nprovide information on available resources or referrals. Information presented in modules is \nadapted from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Your Money Your Goals and FDIC’s \nMoneySmart curriculum. \nWe used the case-study model, including survey methods, to assess the level of consumer \nfinancial capability among low- to moderate-income individuals and families seeking first-time \nhomeownership through this student-led service-learning program. In addition to assessing \nunderstanding of key elements of consumer homebuyer readiness through financial capability \n(including savings, money management, access to banking, credit building, and debt reduction) \nwe also gauged overall sentiment regarding the path to homeownership.  \nResults show anchor institutions, place-based entities such as universities and hospitals \nthat are tied to their surroundings by a mission, invested capital, or relationships to customers, \nemployees, and vendors (Dubb, McKinley and Howard, 2013), can deliver service-learning \nprograms such as a financial coaching program with the potential to expand into underserved \nmarkets as designated by Duty to Serve (DTS), a housing initiative designed to tackle three of \n5 \n \nthe country’s toughest markets, which include manufactured housing, rural housing, and the \npreservation of affordable housing (Federal Housing Finance Agency, 2020). The paper is \norganized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature, both on financial capability and \nhomebuyer readiness, broadly, and on service-learning and anchor institutions, specifically. \nSection 3 describes the survey process and resulting data. Section 4 presents the results. Section \n5 concludes the key findings and avenues for further research. \nLiterature Review \nTo our knowledge, no service-learning program has involved consumers’ financial \ncapability and homebuyer readiness; therefore, we first want to establish some baseline \nknowledge from the larger body of work on financial capability and homebuyer readiness.  \nFinancial Capability \nThere is abundant research on the relationship between financial capability and \nhomebuyer readiness. Financial capability is broadly defined as the ability and opportunity for \nhouseholds to achieve financial well-being (Sherraden, 2013; Xiao et. al, 2016). According to \nSherraden’s financial capability framework, financial capability consists of both internal \ncapabilities, such as financial knowledge, skills, and behaviors, and external conditions, such as \naccess and inclusion in the financial market. Individuals must possess financial knowledge, \nskills, and behaviors to make informed decisions for their best interests. Individuals must also \nlive in an inclusive financial market where they have access to safe financial products and \nservices and where consumer protection policies exist. Together, internal capabilities and \nexternal conditions enable financial capability (Sherraden, 2013). \nFinancial capability moves beyond traditional financial literacy approaches, which solely \nemphasize changes in internal capabilities by acknowledging the external socioeconomic \n6 \n \nconditions that impact an individual’s financial opportunity to achieve financial well-being \n(Sherraden et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2016). The financial capability approach recognizes the \nrelationship between individuals and systems. Due to these factors, individuals have varying \nlevels of financial capability. Research indicates households with lower financial capability are \nmore likely to live in unstable housing, lack personal savings, or achieve their financial goals. \n(Sherraden et al., 2015).  \nThe goal of financial capability programs is to improve financial well-being among \nindividuals and households (CFPB, 2015; Sherraden 2013; Xiao et al., 2016). Due to the limited \nability or reach for individual programs to significantly impact the external conditions, many \napproaches focus primarily on improving internal capabilities. Numerous studies show a positive \ncorrelation between changing internal capabilities and overall financial capability (Mottola et al., \n2017; Rothwell et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2016). Findings suggest that approaches aimed at \nincreasing financial knowledge skills bolster an individual’s financial capability. Furthermore, \nRothwell et al. (2016) discovered supporting internal capabilities requires an understanding of \nhow they are each interrelated, and specifically improving financial self-efficacy is key to \nfostering the relationship between financial knowledge and positive saving behaviors. With this \nin mind, all financial capability approaches acknowledge and actively work to advocate for \nexternal conditions that improve financial capability (Sherraden 2013; Rothwell et al., 2016; \nXiao et al., 2016). \nFinancial capability is essential to the homebuyer readiness of households. Financial \nknowledge, skills, and behaviors are positively correlated with the conditions necessary for \nobtaining homeownership, including money and debt management, savings patterns, and \ncreditworthiness (Grinstead et al., 2011; Sherraden et al., 2015; Asset Funders Networks, 2011). \n7 \n \nFurthermore, access to safe and sound mortgage products and first-time homebuyer supports \nprovide an opportunity for LMI households to attain homeownership. (Olsen, n.d.; Myhre & \nWatson, 2017). \nIncreasing sustainable homeownership among LMI individuals and families by \nincreasing the pool of potential homebuyers who are ready to purchase a home is the goal of \nmany homebuyer education programs. For many LMI individuals, being ready to purchase a \nhome includes access to information about the home purchase process, access to resources, and \nfinancial literacy sufficient to make informed decisions about homeownership. The term we have \nchosen for this is homebuyer readiness. \nHomebuyer Readiness Among Low- to Moderate-income (LMI) Individuals and Families \nSo, why does homebuyer readiness matter?  Moulton et al. (2013), compared the self-\nassessments of participants in the Ohio Housing Finance Agency’s first-time homebuyer \nprogram to their administrative data (credit reports and mortgage loan applications). They found \nthat 31.5% of homebuyers underestimated the amount of their non-mortgage debt by at least \n$5,000 and 11.5% overestimated their debt by at least $2,000. In their findings, homebuyers who \nunderestimated their non-mortgage debt incurred larger mortgage debt and had higher front-end \nratios.  \nHomebuyers who misestimated their non-mortgage debt were also more likely to take up \nan offer of financial coaching. In a study of data from the National Financial Capability Study \nand a large mortgage dataset, An et al. (2015) found that borrowers with lower financial literacy \nscores were more likely to accept riskier loans, pay higher interest rates, and default more often \nthan those with higher scores. An et al. (2015) stated that “our lower bound estimate suggests we \nwould see at least $460 million in reduced annual payments from converting low literacy \n8 \n \nborrowers in California into high literacy borrowers.” (p. 26).  \nMany homebuyer education programs focus on long-term outcomes for those receiving \nhomebuyer education services. Brown (2016) reviewed data from the Tennessee Development \nHousing Agency’s down payment assistance program, which began in 2002. Homebuyer \neducation services were not available during the first six months. This made for a natural \ncomparison to homebuyers who received services during the following six months. Data from \nthe seven-year study period found that those who received homebuyer education services were \n42% less likely to have experienced foreclosure as a terminal outcome at the end of the study \nperiod. One reason for the lower foreclosure rate could be that homebuyers who receive \nhomebuyer education services are more likely to contact a lender if they will not be able to make \na mortgage payment (DeMarco et al., 2016).  In a study of data from HUD’s First-time \nHomebuyer Education and Counseling Demonstration, DeMarco et al. (2016) stated, “[t]he \ntreatment group’s mortgage literacy, credit scores, and communication with lenders \ndemonstrably improved, and all signal steps on the path to sustainable homeownership” (p. 31). \nOne way to increase the impact and use of homebuyer education services among LMI \nborrowers is to seek out LMI individuals and families before they begin the homebuying process. \nOften homebuyers don’t take up offers of homebuyer education until they are already shopping \nfor a home or have a contract to purchase a home. Moulton et al. (2019) also examined data from \nHUD’s First-time Homebuyer Education and Counseling Demonstration. Of those offered free \nhomebuyer education services, 55% initiated services. Services offered included in-person and \nremote services, as well as a general homebuyer education course and one-on-one counseling. \nFurther analysis showed that men, those with co-borrowers, and those later in the home purchase \nprocess were less likely to initiate services. The most common factor cited by homebuyers in this \n9 \n \nstudy who did not initiate services was a scheduling conflict. Moulton et al. (2019) stated their \nfindings “highlight the importance of early intervention in the home purchase process,” (p. 396) \nand further suggested that service providers use these findings to better target their outreach to \npotential participants.  \nA Brief History of Service-learning Programs  \nService-learning is a pedagogy of practice found within the history of community \nengagement (Boyer, 2016; Yates & Accardi, 2019) that can connect academics and research \n(Dodd, 2017), can be evaluated (Metzger, 2012), has a positive impact on students and the \ninstitutions (Vogel & Seifer, 2011), and can broker community-campus partnerships (Levkoe & \nStack-Cutler, 2018). \nThrough a national scan on more than 100 universities nationwide, Yates and Accardi \n(2019) provide a historical background of higher education’s community engagement efforts. \nThe authors segment this history into three distinct waves: civic engagement, service-learning, \nand anchor institutions. Beginning in the 1980s, colleges and universities started to recommit to \ntheir roles of strengthening democracy and educating students to be engaged citizens. Through \nthe establishment of Campus Compact and other similar initiatives, colleges and universities \npromoted student volunteerism and civic engagement efforts across the nation. \nBuilding on this commitment, the service-learning movement grew during the 1990s. The \nyear 1996 was marked by Ernest Boyer (2016), former president of the Carnegie Foundation for \nthe Advancement of Teaching, challenging the field of higher education in the United States of \nAmerica to recommit itself to the scholarship of engagement. Accordingly, service-learning has \nits foundation in the scholarship of engagement. In his work, Boyer stated, \nAt one level, the scholarship of engagement means connecting the rich resources of the \n10 \n \nuniversity to our most pressing social, civic, and ethical problems, to our children, to our \nschools, to our teachers, and to our cities, just to name the ones I am personally in touch \nwith most frequently. You could name others. Campuses would be viewed by both \nstudents and professors not as isolated islands, but as staging grounds for action. (p. 27) \nService-learning programming, embedded within the work of community engagement, \nconnects academic coursework with community service initiatives. Dodd (2017) credibly makes \nthe case for universities to make efforts to engage with their community, as it can provide \nvaluable research opportunities. Dodd states “[s]ervice-learning, when done effectively, can \nextend beyond teaching and service to incorporate research that addresses authentic and complex \nsocial issues of relevance to the community, and, therefore, the university it serves.” (p. 186). \nAdditionally, Dodd argues research and community engagement are interconnected. To offer \nbenefits, universities must first research what exactly the community wants from them. In this \narticle, Dodd points out that a particular service-learning program not only teaches students real-\nworld skills, it also gives universities a real connection to the community, allowing them to learn \nabout issues that matter to the community. The university can then research these specific issues. \nMetzger (2012) contends service-learning programs can be effectively evaluated by \ndemonstrating that students being exposed to real-world events was very impactful on students’ \nlearning outcomes. Vogel and Seifer (2011) explore how service-based learning has a positive \nimpact on students and institutions and that communities benefit from this approach. They found \nthat long-term service-learning plans increase the amount of faculty engagement with the \ncommunity and improve faculty attitudes to community partnerships. Accordingly, service-\nlearning may broker community-campus partnerships. Levkoe & Stack-Cutler (2018) focused on \nhow academic institutions, such as colleges, work with community partners. These partnerships \n11 \n \naim to be mutually beneficial. Additionally, these collaborative efforts aim to benefit society as a \nwhole. The authors argue that to have a successful outcome, both sides must highlight their \nspecific goals and the structure of the partnership. \nThe Role of Anchor Institutions and Proximity to Underserved Markets as Designated by DTS \nMost recently, starting in the early 2000s, colleges and universities started moving \nbeyond community service programs and toward larger community and economic development \nthrough adopting anchor missions (Yates and Accardi, 2019). Dostilio & Welch (2019) \ndistinguish the new anchor institution phase of higher education from previous community \nengagement by approaches having the priority focus of community outcomes in addition to \nstudent development or academic research goals. \nOver the past several decades, communities across the United States have felt the \npersonal effects of a shifting global economy. Since the 1960s, the rise of deindustrialization and \nglobalization have greatly altered the local economy. As the nation has shifted away from a \nmanufacturing-based economy toward a knowledge-based one, cities, towns, and villages have \nwitnessed long-standing for-profit corporations exit their communities (Dubb, McKinley & \nHoward, 2013; Green & Hanna, 2018; Harris & Holley, 2016; Taylor & Luter, 2013, Yates and \nAccardi, 2019). In addition, through the decline of public funding, many communities have \nexperienced sustained instability through unemployment, weakened education systems, unstable \nneighborhoods, and concentrated poverty (Taylor and Luter, 2013).  \nMeanwhile, large, place-based nonprofit entities such as colleges and universities and \nhospitals (commonly referred to as the “eds and meds”), due to the nature of their operations, \nhave remained and increased their presence. As a result, these entities play an increasingly \nimportant role in the social and economic well-being of their communities. (Dubb, McKinley, & \n12 \n \nHoward, 2013; Olinger, Reece & Usher, 2015). For many communities across the United States, \nhospitals and universities represent the area’s largest employer, landowner, and purchaser of \ngoods and services (Green & Hanna, 2018; Harris & Holley, 2016; Taylor & Luter, 2013).  \nThe concept of anchor institutions derived in the literature as a result of the shifting roles \nthat large, non-profit entities play in their communities. According to Dubb, McKinley, and \nHoward (2013), “Anchor institutions are place-based entities such as universities and hospitals \nthat are tied to their surroundings by mission, invested capital, or relationships to customers, \nemployees, and vendors.” Through an extensive review of the literature, Taylor & Luter (2013) \nidentified four common aspects defining anchor institutions: spatial immobility, corporate status, \nsize, and the anchor mission.  \nThe first aspect, spatial immobility, refers to the fixed nature of anchor institutions. \nAnchor institutions have deep roots in their communities by mission, invested capital, or \nrelationship to customers or employees (Webber and Karlstrom, 2007). Secondly, the corporate \nstatus of anchor institutions is that of non-profit entities. Taylor & Luter (2013) highlight the \nconnection to corporate status with spatial immobility. Nonprofit entities such as universities and \nhospitals tend to remain rooted in place regardless of economic condition, whereas communities \nrisk experiencing for-profit entities leaving as profits decline or when economic conditions \nweaken (Taylor and Luter, 2013).  \nThird, the size of anchor institutions must be substantial enough to impact a region’s \neconomy. Anchor institutions must be large enough to impact their communities through \nactivities such as employment, real estate holdings, purchasing power, and cultural influences. \nMost commonly referenced as anchor institutions are hospitals and universities, however, in \nsome cases, libraries, social service agencies, community centers, and faith-based entities may \n13 \n \nalso qualify as anchor institutions.   \nThe fourth and final aspect anchor institutions must have is an anchor mission. Dubb, \nMcKinley, and Howard (2013) define the anchor mission as anchor institutions applying their \nplace-based economic power with human and intellectual resources to better the communities in \nwhich they reside. Large, place-based non-profit entities must acknowledge their roles as anchors \nin their communities to fully serve as anchor institutions.  \nAnchor institution approaches tend to be centered around economic development, \neducation, and health (Dostilio & Welch, 2019). Ehlenz, Birch, and Agness (2014) discuss key \nfindings from case studies from six urban universities. In their findings, the authors found a \nvariety of anchor institution approaches, including neighborhood revitalization, downtown \nredevelopment, and cross-sector partnerships. To help anchor institutions to assess and measure \ntheir impact in their communities, particularly those encompassing low-income populations, the \nDemocracy Collaborative at the University of Maryland developed a framework. This \nframework is comprised of 12 outcome measures, some examples include: affordable housing, \nlocal partners, and financially secure households.  \nRelated to the housing needs of communities, the most cited anchor approaches are \nemployee-assisted housing (EAH) programs and Community Land Trusts (CLT). EAH programs \ntypically assist employees of higher education entities to purchase or rent a home in a \nsurrounding neighborhood to the university. CLT’s are entities that acquire land in order to sell \nor rent to families at an affordable rate (Greene & Hanna, 2018). These approaches have several \npositive benefits and have been successful in addressing the housing needs of many \ncommunities. However, these approaches are still not far-reaching or adopted by many anchor \ninstitutions.  \n14 \n \nTherefore, there are a number of avenues colleges and universities can take in meeting \ncommunity needs and building local economies. As previously mentioned, higher education \ninstitutions serve many important roles in their local economies. Colleges and universities are \nlarge employers, real estate owners, purchasers, educators, and workforce developers (Harris & \nHolley 2016). Although higher education still remains in early adoption of the anchor institution \nphase, there are many outstanding approaches being implemented nationwide. \nDuty to Serve \nThe Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 establishes a duty for Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac to serve three specified underserved markets – manufactured housing, affordable \nhousing preservation, and rural markets (Housing and Economic Recovery Act, 2008). The \nHomeFirst program began with a pilot located in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. Tuscaloosa \nCounty is home to 208,911 residents (Tuscaloosa County, AL, 2020). Education, auto \nmanufacturing, and healthcare are important industries in Tuscaloosa County. The University of \nAlabama is located in Tuscaloosa and is the county’s largest employer, followed by Mercedes-\nBenz U.S. International, Inc., and DCH Regional Medical Center (Economic Development \nPartnership of Alabama, 2019). The median family income in Tuscaloosa County is $66,903, and \nthe median value of an owner-occupied housing unit is $173,800 (HUD, 2019). Sixty-two \npercent of occupied units are owner-occupied and 10% of housing units in Tuscaloosa County \nare mobile homes (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014–2018). Of adults 25 years of age and older, 59% \nreported having attended at least some college. Including residents who had received a high \nschool diploma or equivalent, the rate increases to 90% (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014-2018). It is \nimportant to note that Tuscaloosa County is not a high-needs rural county under the DTS \nprogram, as designated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency; however, in 2017 when Fannie \n15 \n \nMae, The University of Alabama, and other parties came together to develop a pilot at an anchor \ninstitution to help support the development of a financial capability program to consumers in the \nTuscaloosa area, the goal of the service-learning program was to expand financial capability \nservice delivery to increase financial stability and homeownership in high-needs rural markets. \nIn 2019 HomeFirst expanded to include additional rural counties and collaborated with key \nstakeholders to increase the number of participants served. \nThe pilot expanded to include underserved markets in two high-needs rural counties \nunder the DTS program: Greene County and Hale County. Greene County is home to 8,426 \nresidents (Greene County, AL 2020). Manufacturing is a key industry in Greene County, \nfollowed by agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting (Economic Development Partnership of \nAlabama, 2019). The median family income in Greene County is $31,003 (HUD, 2019). The \nmedian value of an owner-occupied housing unit is $67,700 and 68% of occupied units are \nowner-occupied. Forty percent of housing units in Greene County are mobile homes. This is \nmore than double the average for Alabama and the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014–\n2018). The percentage of Greene County residents age 25 and older who reported attending at \nleast some college is 39% (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014–2018).   \nHale County is home to 14,887 residents (Hale County, AL, 2020). Manufacturing and \nhealthcare are important industries in Hale County (Economic Development Partnership of \nAlabama, 2019). The median family income in Hale County is $66,903 (HUD, 2019). The \nmedian value of an owner-occupied housing unit is $88,800 and 75% of occupied units are \nowner-occupied. Thirty-six percent of housing units in Hale County are mobile homes (U.S. \nCensus Bureau, 2014–2018). This is more than double the average for Alabama and the United \nStates. The percentage of Hale County residents age 25 and older who reported attending at least \n16 \n \nsome college is 41% (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014–2018).   \nResearch on anchor institutions is only a few decades old. As a result, gaps in the \nliterature still exist. The majority of the research focuses on anchor institutional approaches in \nurban settings. Further examination into the role and approaches of anchor institutions with \nproximity to underserved markets as designated by DTS is needed. Additionally, there is sparse \nresearch on anchor institution approaches in the Southeastern U.S. Furthermore, there is minimal \nresearch on the role students play in anchor institution approaches, both as actors within higher \neducation settings and their local economies. \nSurvey Methodology and Data  \nDuring July 1, 2018–June 30, 2020, we reviewed collected data of 100 participants to \nunderstand participant perceptions about financial capability and their perspectives toward \nhomeownership in order to begin the process of developing a conceptual framework to identify \nexisting assets in high-needs rural counties across the state of Alabama. Therefore, the findings, \nalthough deep and insightful, may not be projectable to all high-needs rural counties. In order to \nexpand our reach to high-needs rural counties with proximity to The University of Alabama, \nHomeFirst identified community resources, financial tools, and affordable housing programs to \nfurther support attainable and sustainable housing. HomeFirst established partnerships with local \nnon-profit organizations, governmental agencies, and large employers to recruit participants. In \naddition to recruitment through community partners, recruitment flyers were posted in areas of \nhigh visibility such as libraries and community centers. Recruitment of participants in our initial \nexpansion into high-needs rural counties was similar to the Tuscaloosa County cohort in which \nparticipants met in-person with HomeFirst staff to complete registration. In all three counties \nHomeFirst staff identified relevant community stakeholders to market the program to LMI \n17 \n \nindividuals. However, program registration and the mode of service delivery in high-needs rural \ncounty cohorts varied from the Tuscaloosa County cohort. Community partners in Greene and \nHale counties completed registration for some participants. Tuscaloosa County cohort \nparticipants met with a coach to complete registration.   \nIn addition to program data, this study utilizes program history generated under \nsponsored research agreements and deliverables developed during the pilot program.  \nThis study uses a mixed-methods research design in order to have both qualitative and \nquantitative research to gain breadth and depth of understanding to inform best practices that \npromote the financial and housing stability of Alabamians. In addition, this study explores the \nimportant and necessary role higher education institutions in Alabama have to partner as anchor \ninstitutions to advance effective best practices that promote the financial and housing stability of \nall Alabamians. \nParticipants’ involvement in the study occurred in one or both of the following ways: 1) a \nretrospective review of program artifacts completed by the participant throughout engagement \nwith the HomeFirst program and/or 2) a semi-structured interview occurring at the conclusion of \nthe individual’s engagement with the HomeFirst program. Each person entering the program was \nasked to sign a privacy statement. This privacy statement was designed to provide participants \nwith information on privacy, inform participants about their rights, and inform participants how \ntheir information remains secure. We only had access to collect information that participants \nvoluntarily gave us. The data collected, including demographic data, was self-reported by the \nparticipants. The data collected was provided to us orally, on the application or on other forms. \nWe assured participants that all the information shared both orally and in writing would be \nmanaged within legal and ethical considerations, including not selling their personal information \n18 \n \nand only releasing their personal information to third parties with consent. All participants were \ninformed that we may also collect, use, and share anonymous aggregated case file information to \nevaluate our services, to gather valuable research information, and to design future programs. \nThe retrospective review of program artifacts included a pre-, post- Financial Capability \nScale (FCS) questionnaire, follow-up questionnaires, learning modules, and meeting notes. The \nFCS is a standardized evaluation of financial capability that demonstrates client impacts and is  \nused by financial coaching programs presented in the financial literature (Collins & O’Rourke, \n2013). In 2013, the Center for Financial Security at the University of Wisconsin-Madison \ndeveloped the FCS. This scale contains six questions with two optional alternative questions and \nis measured on an eight-point scale to assess financial well-being. Questions cover topics related \nto money management, financial behaviors, and confidence. Of the six standard questions, four \nquestions focus on observable behaviors. An example of one of these questions’ states, “Do you \ncurrently have a personal budget, spending plan, or financial plan?” Two questions focus on the \nmeasurement of consumer confidence. An example of a question measuring confidence states, \n“How confident are you in your ability to achieve a financial goal you set for yourself today?”  \nThe scale is intended to create a standardized method to observe participant progress in financial \ncoaching programs (Cohen, Hoagland, & Wiedrich, 2017). \nTo better interpret data, the FCS can be broken down into three levels: Low (0–3); \nmoderate (4–5); and high (6–8). Research shows these three FCS levels correlate with key \nelements of financial well-being, including level of debt, asset, stress and emergency savings. \nFor example, once an individual’s assets and emergency savings increase, they tend to score \nhigher on the FCS. Higher levels of financial stress and debt consistently are tied to a lower FCS \nlevel (Asset Funders Networks, 2011).  \n19 \n \nFor our purpose, the FCS allowed the measurement of changes in both behavior and \nconfidence in participants’ ability to handle their finances in the future by calculating the pre- \nand post-FCS score based on the six standard questions. Participants were asked additional \nquestions to understand the usage of payday loans and of mainstream banking services. \nParticipants were informed about the interview portion of the study at the conclusion of \nthe HomeFirst program registration process. Publicity flyers detailing the study were shared to \nindividuals participating in the HomeFirst program on the campus of The University of Alabama \nor at partner site locations. Participants were able to enroll in the study at any time during their \ninvolvement with the HomeFirst program. To prevent potential coercion that could have \noccurred with participation in the study versus engagement with the HomeFirst program, \nparticipants were explicitly informed that participation or non-participation in the study had no \nimpact on the individuals’ ability to engage with the HomeFirst program. To further minimize \npossible coercion, individuals were informed of the study after registering into the HomeFirst \nprogram. Furthermore, interviews took place in a location that was removed from the HomeFirst \nservice delivery location.  \nEach person agreeing to participate in semi-structured interviews was asked to read and \nsign an informed consent document. The purpose of the informed consent document was to \ncommunicate to the participant the nature of the study, right to privacy, and reassure protection \nfrom harm. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two participants to further enhance \ndata interpretation. Interviews were via the phone. The interviews took 60 minutes each and were \naudio recorded.  \nThe semi-structured interview prompted participants to discuss goals of homeownership; \nhousing stability before, and if applicable, after purchasing their home; perception of available \n20 \n \nsupportive services and resources; and the role the HomeFirst program had, if any, on goals of \nhomeownership. Sample questions included “What does homeownership mean to you?”, “What \nresources and services do you feel are available to support you in becoming a homeowner?”, and \n“Did you feel comfortable discussing personal financial matters with your financial coach?” \nProbing questions were then used as a strategy to obtain more information. \nThe results from each interview were transcribed by a member of the research team and a \npseudonym assigned to each participant. Once transcribed, the electronic record of the interviews \nwas destroyed. A key associating the pseudonym with the actual name and contact information \nof each participant will be kept in the Principle Investigator’s (PI) UA Box for six years after \ncompletion of the study, after which time, the key will be destroyed. Only the researchers will \nhave access to the collected data during the study. At no point (before, during, or after the study) \nwill the identity of the participant be revealed to anyone other than the research team and at any \ntime during the interviews, the participants had the right to rescind their consent to participate.  \nUpon completion of the study, only the PI will have access to the collected data, and all \ncollected data will be stored in the PI’s UA Box for six years after completion of the study. \nIn addition, we gathered data through module completion and participant satisfaction with the \nHomeFirst program. The learning modules were a set of financial education lessons that were \ncompleted by the participant throughout HomeFirst program involvement. Meeting notes \ndetailing participant activities with the program were recorded. Program artifacts were obtained \nin paper or electronically with the participant’s consent at the conclusion of the participant’s \ninvolvement with the HomeFirst program. \n \n \n21 \n \nResults  \nWe reviewed data from July 1, 2018–June 30, 2020 from 100 participants. Two \nparticipants were excluded due to missing registration and program data. Of the remaining 98 \nparticipants, 25 individuals participated in the 2018–2019 (July 1, 2018–June 30, 2019) program \ncohort and 73 individuals participated in the 2019–2020 (July 1, 2019–June 30, 2020) cohort.  \nDemographic information collected at program intake and outlined in Table 1 indicates \nparticipants identified predominantly as female (93%), African American (98%), and range in \nage from 19 to 74 with an average age of 44. Participants were predominantly renters (81%), the \nmajority of participants were employed full-time (59%), and over half (53%) had at least some \npostsecondary education. All participants maintained an income below the area median family \nincome in the region (or $66,900 for a family of four) (HUD, 2019). There were on average 2.8 \nindividuals per household, with majority of households comprising single mothers with children. \nParticipants resided in Tuscaloosa County (64%), Greene County (25%), and Hale County \n(10%). Participant engagement with the HomeFirst program primarily occurred during the three-\nmonth program cycle in fall 2018 and fall 2019. During this time, participants met individually \nwith a financial coach. Coaching meetings, as noted in Table 2, primarily focused on completing \nHomeFirst modules, which provided information and resources to prepare participants for \nhomeownership. Participants completed 4.7 modules on average. As noted in Table 3, in total, \n341 financial coaching meetings were held during both three-month program cycles (110 \nmeetings in Fall 2018 and 231 in Fall 2019) and on average, participants attended 3.6 meetings.  \nThe number of meetings offered in the high-needs rural counties was less than the \nnumber of meetings offered to the Tuscaloosa County cohort. Hale County cohort participants \nwere offered three meeting times. The Greene County cohort participants were offered two \n22 \n \nmeeting times. The Tuscaloosa County cohort participants had the opportunity to meet 6–8 \ntimes. To offset the limited meetings offered in high-needs rural counties, the meeting times \nwere extended to allow for more modules to be covered in a single meeting. This variation in \nservice delivery is reflected in the data in Table 2, which shows an average meeting attendance \nin Greene County of .7 meetings and the average number of modules completed being over three \ntimes higher (2.9 modules). Compare this to the Tuscaloosa County cohort where the average \nnumber of meetings and average number of modules are nearly identical. The Hale County \ncohort numbers were affected by two Hale County participants who chose to travel to the \nTuscaloosa County cohort site for additional meetings. This resulted in a higher average meeting \nattendance and average number of modules completed.  \nHomeFirst participants completed a pre- and post- questionnaire incorporating the \nFinancial Capability Scale before and after the three-month program engagement. Table 3 \npresents financial capability scale data taken at program intake. Participants’ intake responses \nranged from 0–7, with the average score being 4.0. Over half (57%) of participants had a \npersonal budget or financial plan. Over half (60%) reported that total spending on living \nexpenses was less than total income. Nearly three out of four (72%) participants had both \nchecking and savings accounts. About one in five (17%) used a payday loan in the past three \nmonths. FCS data collected at program intake was consistent to baseline data of other financial \ncoaching programs (Cohen et al., 2017). In efforts to deepen the statistical analysis of the \nHomeFirst impacts in the upcoming program year there is potential to incorporate the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau Financial Well-Being Scale (Bureau, Consumer Financial \nProtection, 2015). This scale incorporates IRT modeling (Knoll et. al, 2012) which is the method \nof choice for standardized educational testing and other domains in which score precision is \n23 \n \ncritical (Prosperity Now, 2017). It allows the community organization to utilize classical test \ntheory techniques to analyze the data collected through iterative surveys and create scores that \nare comparable to one another. Using IRT, we will be able to take into account certain properties \nof the questions themselves in order to assess individuals’ level of financial literacy (Knoll et. al, \n2012). This analysis includes a user guide provided by the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau for those not familiar with the dense technical aspects of statistical modeling, as well as a \ntechnical report to understand the elements that render the financial well-being. \nFinancial Capability and Homebuyer Readiness Impacts \nInitial results suggest the HomeFirst program had positive effects on the financial \ncapability of participants. Table 4 displays the FCS data for participants at program exit. \nParticipants’ exit responses ranged from 1–8, with the average score of 5.8. Participants who \ncompleted both pre- and post- program assessments scored on average 1.7 points higher on the \nFCS compared to program intake data (5.8 points versus 4.1). Average changes in pre-, post- \nFCS scores were consistent, and in some cases slightly higher than similar financial coaching \nprograms (Cohen, Hoagland, & Wiedrich, 2017). \nFurthermore, exit data show the HomeFirst program had impacted participants’ \nhomebuyer readiness. The average participant saved $652 over the three-month period. Over half \n(65%) noted that the frequency in which they saved increased over the past three months. \nParticipants paid off an average of $662 in debt during the three-month program. The majority \n(85%) of participants reported making “some” progress toward reducing debt and over half \n(62%) reported seeing a positive change in their credit score over the past three months. \nThe path to sustainable homeownership can be intimidating for LMI families. This was \ndemonstrated in interviews with two participants. A participant from Tuscaloosa County (2019) \n24 \n \nstated, “I was just scared because to be honest, I was afraid to sign something [loan for a \nmortgage] that I wasn’t sure I was going to be able to pay for. The Homebuying process is \nstressful and that fear was my biggest barrier.” In efforts to gain knowledge about the \nhomebuying process this participant stated she wanted to “see if there was a program I can utilize \nbefore I went the traditional route of going to the lender directly just because I knew that can be \nvery, very complicated” (p. 3). \nThese statements demonstrate a level of discomfort with the homebuying process and a \nlack of confidence in knowledge of the process. This lack of knowledge and confidence could \nimpact LMI borrowers’ decisions about when to apply for a mortgage and the lender or program \nthe borrower chooses to use. An et al. (2015) found that lower financial literacy correlated to \nborrowers accepting riskier loans with higher payments.  \nResearch by Moulton et al. (2013) found that 43% of LMI borrowers misestimate their \ncurrent debt level when compared to their credit reports and mortgage applications. In an \ninterview, the participant from Tuscaloosa County described what she discovered when she \nreviewed her credit report as well as her credit score. She stated: “My credit I thought was a big \nproblem until I got my credit report and looked at it for myself and it was not that I did not have \ngood credit, I just did not have a lot of credit because I was not a person that financed,” \n(Tuscaloosa County participant, personal communication, 2019, p. 12). \nIntake data from participants also show that confidence in their ability to achieve a \nfinancial goal (question 2 on the FCS) was significantly higher than confidence in their ability to \npay their monthly expenses if faced with an unexpected expense (question 3 on the FCS). In \naddition, participants in 2019 were asked to describe their current credit record at intake. Only \n12% described their credit as good or very good. Moulton et al. (2013) noted this potentially \n25 \n \nshows that individuals are overconfident about their credit. Misestimation of current finances and \noverconfidence correlates to increased front-end ratios.  \nEarly homebuyer education leads to increased FCS scores. This increase should correlate \nfavorably to borrowers’ ability to attain affordable mortgages with lower front-end ratios. Since \nhomebuyer education correlates to lower foreclosure rates (Brown, 2016), and to the borrowers’ \nincreased likelihood of contacting a lender (DeMarco et al., 2016), the reduction could also \ncorrelate to higher FSC scores and better affordability ratios, thus increasing sustainability over \nthe long-term. This effect is demonstrated by the Tuscaloosa County participant’s statement, “it \nwas comforting just to know that okay we could definitely always keep the house no matter what \nour current financial status because the payment is so low” (p. 5). \nObserving the financial capability and homebuyer readiness of participants in the three-\ncounty service area provides insight into the unique needs and circumstances within each county. \nInitial results identify slight variations in the pre-, post- FCS between Tuscaloosa, Greene, and \nHale County participants. At program enrollment, Tuscaloosa County participants scored 4.4 on \naverage, followed by Hale County with 4.2, and Greene County with 3.5 points on average. At \nprogram exit, Tuscaloosa County participants scored 6.2 points (or a 1.8-point increase), \nfollowed by Greene County 5.2 (+1.7), and Hale County 4.5 (+0.3). Greene County participants \nexperienced a 48.6% increase in FCS scores, the largest percent increase amongst the three \ncounties. (Tables 3 and 4). \nThere were also slight variations in the homebuyer readiness of participants by county of \nresidence. Tuscaloosa County participants saved $909 on average over the three-month program \nengagement, followed by $281 average saved for Greene County participants, and $63 saved for \nHale County participants. There were differences in perceived progress toward paying off debt. \n26 \n \nAmongst the cohort, 100% of Greene County participants reported making “some” or “a lot” of \nprogress toward reducing debt; followed by 96% of Tuscaloosa County and 75% of Hale County \nparticipants. Meanwhile, 78% of Tuscaloosa County participants reported a positive change in \ntheir credit score over the past three months compared to half of Hale County and one quarter of \nGreene County participants (UA HomeFirst Metrics Report 2019).  \nVariations in program outcomes within the three-county cohort may point to differences \nin the external conditions within each of these counties. For instance, financial access varies \ngreatly between the rural counties and Tuscaloosa County, and all three counties lag behind \nnationally. In 2017, the unbanked rate (or the percentage of households with neither a checking \nnor savings account) was 19.2% and 12.2% for Greene and Hale County residents respectively \n(compared to 8.7% in Tuscaloosa County). These rates are significantly higher than the 6.5% \nnational average. (Prosperity Now 2020). These trends suggest the need for further research into \nhow the external conditions facing high-needs rural counties impact financial capability and \nhomebuyer readiness.  \nStudent-led Service-learning Approach \nThe HomeFirst service-learning program was designed to provide the primary source of \ncoaching for participants by undergraduate students. The program was designed as Vogel and \nSeifer (2011) describe, to have a positive impact on students, institutions, and ultimately the \nlarger communities. The author found that long-term service-learning plans increase the amount \nof faculty engagement with the community and improve faculty attitudes to community \npartnerships. When asked to reflect on the program, participants noted pace and the \nindividualized nature of the program were beneficial. For example, a participant (2019) from \nGreene County, Alabama stated, “I’m glad it was just not rushed through like the other class I \n27 \n \ntook. HomeFirst actually gave me the opportunity to take my time and do the modules one at a \ntime. They didn’t try to rush you through it all in one day.” The participant from Tuscaloosa \nCounty stated, “There was a uniqueness to HomeFirst...it was very fluid. [Coaches would say] as \nfar as [they] know we need to cover this module or if you’re ahead and [you] already know these \nthings I can find you things specific to your experience” (p. 3).  \nMeeting clients where they were was important to the Tuscaloosa County participant who \nrecalled, “And so, their goal is, of course, to help establish homeownership and to get \n[participants] ready for homeownership. But the homeowners have varying needs…including \nmyself and everybody else who participated. So, I think HomeFirst really tries to embody \npartnership, uniqueness, individuality, and meeting the client where they truly are.” (p. 3) \nAdditionally, the Greene County participant stated, “… I think that was the best part, that you get \nto sit one-on-one with your coach and talk instead of in a group with 15 people and everybody’s \nnot on the same level” (p.7). \nThe Role of Colleges and Universities as Anchor Institutions \nAccordingly, service-learning is also known to broker community-campus partnerships. \nLevkoe & Stack-Cutler (2018) stated the ways in which academic institutions, such as colleges, \nwork with community partners, and in this case, participants who saw themselves as partners \nwith the HomeFirst program. A partnership was one way the program was described by the \nparticipant from Tuscaloosa County who stated, “So it was a partnership… A lot of times...for a \nlot of programs, it is you meeting their expectations. And sometimes that’s because, I mean, \n[other programs are] grant program[s] and they have to have certain expectations, and sometimes \nit is just not available because of the agency culture….I think that HomeFirst really embodies \ntrue partnership where both parties feel heard and that their needs are being met” (pp. 2–3).  \n28 \n \nLevkoe & Stack-Cutler (2018) state these partnerships aim to be mutually beneficial. \nAdditionally, these collaborative efforts aim to benefit society as a whole. The authors argue that \nin order to have a successful outcome, both sides must highlight their specific goals, and the \nstructure of the partnership. This was apparent with the interactions of our coaches and \nparticipants. For example, an anonymous 2019 participant stated during a case study interview, \n“I actually felt more comfortable working with the college students because it’s something \nthey’re working toward. I think their title doesn’t matter. I think that anyone can deliver the \nprogram if they’re truly committed to the mission. And they’re truly committed to cultural \nsensitivity, and they’re truly committed to going the extra mile and relationships. I think students \nare prime candidates for that because they typically are more open minded. And just, you know, \n[they are] freer thinkers and have more energy. Then, you know, some…professionals who’ve \nbeen in the field quite a while. [Students] have a fresh perspective. So, I think it’s a great \naddition and a new way to build relationships between communities and students” (p. 4). \nIn his work, Boyer (2016) echoes what this participant stated with acknowledgement of \nthe wealth of resources anchor institutions have to share by stating “[a]t one level, the \nscholarship of engagement means connecting the rich resources of the university to our most \npressing social, civic, and ethical problems, to our children, to our schools, to our teachers, and \nto our cities” (p. 27). This is mirrored in another personal recollection of the Tuscaloosa County \nparticipant who stated, “I think sometimes it’s easy to become separated from community needs \nespecially in areas that are not so… you know... this is a college town, so some areas have \ninstitutions, but they’re not college towns. And so, I really appreciate how the university has \ntaken charge and [addressed] homeownership in Tuscaloosa. [T]here’s something I really \nappreciate about the university and I’ve seen over my time here. They’re responsive to the need, \n29 \n \nthey’re in a position with resources, with research abilities, with grant capabilities, with student \nbodies, literally, you know, to actually perform the work, and they respond to the call.” \nDodd (2017) echoes the sentiment regarding the ways in which Universities make efforts \nto engage with their community, as it can provide valuable research opportunities. Dodd states \n“[s]ervice-learning, when done effectively, can extend beyond teaching and service to \nincorporate research that addresses authentic and complex social issues of relevance to the \ncommunity and, therefore, the university it serves” (p. 186). \nKey Findings/Conclusions  \nHomebuyer readiness for our purposes consists of overcoming the barriers that prevent \nLMI individuals and families from accessing affordable, sustainable homeownership. The most \ncommon obstacles (within the scope of our financial coaching program) are access to \nconventional/mainstream banking system, savings, money management, debt management, and \nknowledge of credit.  \nOur results show that participants enrolled in our program were able to increase access to \nbanking as evidenced by opening new savings or checking accounts, reduced reliance on \npredatory lending products, such as payday or title loans, and fewer participants reported being \nunbanked. Participants increased the frequency and amount saved during the program, reported \nan increased use a of a budget or spending plan, high confidence in managing their money, an \nincrease in credit scores and high confidence in their ability to increase their score in the future.  \nEvidence from our pilot study shows that the gains made are significant and participants were \nable to maintain the gains after the program was over.  \nOne area of interest and possible future study is the seeming incongruence of \nparticipant’s confidence in their ability to set and achieve a financial goal and their perception of \n30 \n \ntheir credit history. The expectation might be for those who view their credit history negatively \nto also have less confidence in their ability to set and achieve financial goals. However, this is \nnot the case in our study participants. In 2019 only 12% of participants described their credit as \ngood or very good, conversely a majority of participants (62%) indicated they were very \nconfident in their ability to set and achieve a financial goal. More than current perceptions of \ncreditworthiness, this confidence could be a factor in whether a participant accepts the offer of \nfinancial coaching or a factor in successful completion of the program. This insight could inform \nhow financial coaching is offered (marketed) to participants with less confidence. As was shown \npreviously, misconceptions about credit history, how to improve credit scores, what is \nconsidered a good credit score, as well as overconfidence could lead participants to make less \nfavorable financial decisions.  \nThe population of the participants in the HomeFirst program consists of a higher-than-\nexpected percentage of participants who reported attending at least some college. A recent report \nby the Pew Research Center documents a significant increase in college attendance by low- to \nmoderate-income individuals (Pew Research Center, 2019), which could account for the higher-\nthan-expected number. Future research is suggested in the area of college attendance, student \nloan debt, and the relationship to financial capability.   \nAnother area for future study includes whether LMI borrowers are more likely to accept \nan offer of financial coaching through an anchor institution compared to similarly structured \nprograms conducted through a social service agency. Anecdotal evidence from study participants \nsuggest that the student coaching model in an academic setting carries less stigma and therefore \nparticipants may be more willing to accept an offer of financial coaching.  \nThis study also determined financial capability is essential to the financial well-being of \n31 \n \nLMI households. Initial results over a two-year pilot program suggest the HomeFirst program \nhad positive impacts on the financial capability of participants. Individuals in the program \nexperienced a 1.7-point average increase in Financial Capability Scale scores through program \ninvolvement. Average changes in pre-, post- FCS scores were consistent and, in some cases \nslightly higher than similar financial coaching programs (Cohen, Hoagland, & Wiedrich, 2017). \nParticipants who completed the HomeFirst program observed positive changes in their saving \nhabits, money management, access to banking, credit profile, level of debt, and homebuyer \nreadiness.  \n  \nBy offering a participant-centered, service delivery approach, the HomeFirst program \nwas able to more effectively support households on their path toward homeownership. \nIndividuals felt a heightened ability to achieve their financial goals. Through forming meaningful \nrelationships among participants, undergraduate student coaches, The University of Alabama, \nand asset-building organizations, the HomeFirst approach offers low- to-moderate income \nhouseholds the resources and support they need to enter the pool of potential successful, \nsustainable homeowners. \nFurthermore, there is an increased need for anchor institutions to address the external \nstructural conditions contributing to financial capability, to ensure every individual has the \nability and opportunity to reach their financial goals in an inclusive financial market. Through \ncontinued partnership and increased collaboration with area nonprofits, local government \nentities, financial institutions, and community stakeholders, The University of Alabama is in a \nposition to effectively build a strong infrastructure of support for all households seeking financial \nstability, including those underserved markets as designated by DTS. \nFinally, colleges and universities have a long-standing history of serving as change \n32 \n \nagents in local communities and for helping to bolster economic development. Since the \nestablishment of land-grant universities in 1862, the purpose of higher education has been to \nserve the community, primarily through research and education (Olinger, Reece, & Usher 2015). \nMore recently, over the past three decades, colleges and universities have renewed this civic and \nsocial mission through the development of civic engagement initiatives, service-learning \nprograms, and more recently through adopting the anchor mission. \nThere is additional opportunity for anchor institutions to work collaboratively with \ncommunities and social service agencies in order to fill gaps to build a more complete \ninfrastructure of support. Participants expressed the true “sparkle” of the program was the dignity \nand self-worth the program offered participants. We have reason to believe there is an \nopportunity for this program to be a direct promoter of social justice and can help to break \nstructural inequalities (e.g. generational poverty) while working on financial capability. \nConsidering the conversations and actions occurring around our nation focused on racial justice \nand reconciliation, in its small way, this program, offered at an anchor institution, offers a \nhelpful and collaborative way of combating historic disenfranchisement. \nCollege students can be in the family of social service providers and can provide us \ninsight on how to deliver services. We hope to have the opportunity in the future to explore the \nsense of community, respect, and facilitation in an inclusive environment that was experienced \nby participants. However, for now, anchor institutions have a history in their local communities \nand can add value. Therefore, it is our position that service-learning programs at anchor \ninstitutions should get to work contributing to increasing homebuyer readiness through financial \ncapability. \n \n \n33 \n \nReferences  \n \nAlabama Possible.

    "text": "When a property owner dies without a will or estate or when they leave the property to multiple heirs, it can create a number of financial barriers to inheritors receiving the full value of the property. In many cases, without a clear title, property owners are unable to access the equity in their home for maintenance purposes, sell the home at market rates, or obtain a mortgage, which can make them vulnerable to forced sales and property loss.\n\"A Methodological Approach to Estimate Residential Heirs’ Property in the United States,\" developed by the Housing Assistance Council in partnership with Fannie Mae, provides an estimate of the prevalence and impact of heirs’ title issues on a national scale.\nRead the report\nThe total assessed value of properties impacted by heirship issues is conservatively estimated to be over $32B across 44 states and the District of Columbia.\nWhile rural census tracts contain only about 30% of the country’s homes, they contain nearly two thirds (64.6%) of the country’s heirs’ properties.\nWith homeownership among the primary means of wealth transfer in the U.S., heirship issues have the potential to expand the wealth gap.\nHeirship issues impact the ability of thousands of homeowners to build wealth through their homes. Read “A Methodological Approach to Estimate Residential Heirs’ Property in the United States” for insights into this complicated issue and to understand the scale of the problem throughout the United States.\nDownload the report\nFannie Mae is pleased to have partnered with the Housing Assistance Council (HAC) to estimate the scope of heirship property issues in the United States. Working together, we hope to develop solutions that address such problems and ensure homeowners can access the equity and wealth in their homes."

Residents engage in a housing journey towards purchasing \nproperty and gaining wealth through equity. The homeownership journey has been historically and systemically exclusionary, \ncontributing to the racial wealth gap. Over generations, Native American and Black households have lost land due to a variety of \nsystemic issues, including lack of access to a clear title. One form of title issues, heirs’ property, is defined as properties with \nmultiple owners and no clear title. \nHeirs’ Property Can Be Created When Multiple Descendants Inherit the Property Without a Formal Transfer of Title  \nHeirs’ property can be created by an owner passing away without a will, leading to the descendants inheriting the property with \nshared ownership. Properties inherited through wills or another form of estate planning can also become heirs’ property when \nthe owner chooses to leave the property to multiple descendants. If the heirs do not complete the formal title transfer process \ndue to finances, a misunderstanding of the system, or family disagreements, the title becomes tangled. \nHeirs’ Property Owners Face Many Barriers Without Access to a Clear Title \nOwners of properties without a clear title are not able to access the equity in their home or maintain the property to allow the \nvalue to appreciate. A clear title is needed to sell the home at market rate or to obtain a mortgage, loans for upkeep, or insurance. \nHeirs’ property owners are vulnerable to forced sales and property loss. \nThe Housing Assistance Council (HAC), in Partnership With Fannie Mae, Conducted a Quantitative Analysis to Estimate the \nPrevalence of Heirs’ Properties  \nResearch on heirs’ property has been ongoing for over 40 years. The estimates of the prevalence of heirs’ property parcels have \nranged from 0.03 percent to 9.6 percent. Most published research to date were limited specific localities due to the challenges of \ndata availability and uniformity. In June 2023, Dobbs and Johnson Gaither published the first national estimate of heirs’ property. \nUsing tax-assessment data provided by Fannie Mae via ICE Mortgage Technology, Inc., HAC aimed to estimate the prevalence of \nheirs’ property in the country. HAC estimated the prevalence of two classifications of properties: those that are most likely heirs’ \nproperties and properties that are at risk of currently being or soon becoming heirs’ property. HAC analyzed owner characteristics \nfor indications of transfer of ownership upon the owner’s death without completing the formal transfer of title. Property \ncharacteristics were also analyzed to identify properties with low building quality, no full tax exemptions, no recent sale, and no \nmortgage amount. \nThe Estimates of the Prevalence of Heirs’ Property are Conservative Due to Data Issues  \nNon-uniformity in tax assessment data collection poses a challenge when identifying heirs’ property. Localities have varied tax \nassessment processes and data reporting. Most estimates of heirs’ property to date have been limited due to issues associated \nwith data availability. HAC had access to a robust data set that included all assessed residential properties except vacant \nproperties. Nevertheless, due to missing assessment data, the exclusion of vacant properties, and non-uniformity in assessment \nprocesses, the research estimate of the prevalence of heirs’ property across the country is very conservative. Six states, due to \ndata accessibility and quality issues, were omitted from the analysis entirely. \nThe primary aim of this research is to present the relative prevalence of heirs’ property. The estimates of identified heirs’ property \nwere very sensitive to specific indicators, including housing quality. The methodology produced a range, but researchers used the \nmore conservative estimate for analysis. Estimates are as high as 10 percent in some states. Although the estimates are \nconservative, considering relative prevalence across counties and states can inform targeted outreach and mitigation strategies. \nThe findings of this research are a baseline on which localities can incorporate identifiers and variables unique to their \ncommunities. \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 5 of 50 \n \nThe Assessed Value of Identified Heirs’ Properties is $32 Billion Across 44 States and the District of Columbia  \nThe total assessed value of all identified heirs’ properties from 44 states and the District of Columbia is approximately $32.3 \nbillion. This is a very conservative figure due to the omitted states and some counties with identified heirs’ property that did not \nhave reported total assessed values. Additionally, depending on the localities’ assessment practices, the assessed value may \ndiffer from the market value. This is a minimum estimate of the amount of wealth made inaccessible to households and \ncommunities by title issues. \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 6 of 50 \nIdentified Heirs’ Properties are Disproportionately Located in Rural Census Tracts  \nConducting an analysis using the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s (FHFA) Duty to Serve 2022 rural geography, approximately \ntwo-thirds of identified heirs’ properties are in rural census tracts.  \n \n \nRecommendations to Address the Issues of Heirs’ Property Include Access to Complete Data, Education, Legal Aid, \nFinancial Support, and Policy Changes  \nA multifaceted approach is needed to prevent the creation of future heirs’ properties and aid current owners with title issues. Due \nto data availability issues, estimates of the prevalence of heirs’ property have been conservative. Access to complete and uniform \ndata is needed to identify heirs’ property to inform targeted solutions. Continued national and localized research on the \nprevalence of heirs’ property and the efficacy of solutions is needed. This will require a collaborative effort with commitments of \nfinancial support. \nHeirs’ property owners need legal aid, mediation, and financial support to complete the legal processes needed to clear titles. \nEducation for current and future homeowners and access to legal aid are needed to support homeowners as they make informed \ndecisions to prevent future title issues.  \nFinancial support is needed for current and former heirs’ property owners. Many heirs’ property owners face barriers to accessing \nthe capital needed to maintain the property. Financial products that are inclusive of all forms of homeownership are needed. \nAdditionally, former heirs’ property owners who have successfully cleared the property title need financial support to utilize the \nfull benefit of newly accessible equity from their property.  \nPolicy changes are needed to protect heirs’ property owners and increase land retention. Twenty-three states, to date, have \nadopted The Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act (UPHPA). This state legislation aims to mitigate the threat of land loss by \nproviding heirs’ property owners with increased protection and advanced notice in the event of a partition sale. While this state \nlegislation provides some additional protection for heirs’ property owners to retain ownership of their property, additional \nfinancial support is needed for owners who may pursue purchasing the divided interest from their co-owners. Additional federal \npolicy changes are needed to expand access to legal aid, financial support, inclusion, and protection of heirs’ property owners. \nSolutions must allow property owners to choose their preferred form of land control while still being able to access the full \nbenefits of homeownership. Heirs’ property owners deserve to retain their land, accumulate wealth, and have autonomy over \ntheir property. \n \n \n70.0%\n35.4%\n30.0%\n64.6%\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n% All Properties\n% Most Likely & At-Risk Heirs\nPercent of Properties\nFHFA Duty to Serve Rural Geography and Identified Heirs' \nProperties\nSuburban/Urban\nRural\n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 7 of 50 \nBackground on Heirs’ Property in the United States \n \n \n \nPhoto: Rory Doyle. – There is more Work to Be Done \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 8 of 50 \nBackground on Heirs’ Property in the United States \nHomeownership and the Racial Wealth Gap \nIn the United States, property and homeownership have been foundational to wealth accumulation, access, and personal and \npolitical agency. For some households, land ownership has cultural significance and serves as a connection to family and \ncommunity. Yet the structures that support land retention and wealth accumulation have systemically excluded many residents \nincluding Indigenous, Black, and other communities of color, and residents of regions with persistent poverty.  \nThe path to homeownership and the ability to build equity from homeownership looks different for each resident. The path can \nbe broken down into four stages of a housing journey.1 Typically, residents prepare to access housing and decide between renting \nand owning. Then, usually while renting, residents engage in the process of purchasing a home. Upon a successful purchase, \nowners move in and maintain their homes as the property appreciates. Residents may later choose to move or sell their homes \nand repeat the journey.  \nHowever, residents of color and low-income residents disproportionately face challenges along the journey to homeownership. \nNative American, Black, and Hispanic households have less generational wealth, higher cost burdens, and unequal access to \nfinancial systems than their White peers.2, 3 These racial disparities persist and affect residents’ ability to become homeowners or \nacquire wealth from homeownership.  \nThe homeownership gap between White households (73 percent) and Black households (44 percent) is the highest it has been in \nten years. The homeownership rates of residents of color demonstrate the disparities in access to homeownership. Nationwide \nhomeownership rates are 56.7 percent for Native Americans,4 50.6 percent for Hispanics, and 63 percent for Asian Americans.  \nWhen Native American, Black, and Hispanic residents do become homeowners, they are more likely to be cost burdened, \nexperience higher rates of housing repair needs and own homes in regions disproportionately affected by natural disasters and \nhazardous waste.5, 6 \nHomeowners do not always acquire their properties through the typical process. Some homeowners reside on familial land or in \nfamily homes, and eventually inherit the property. This path to homeownership also presents challenges that disproportionately \naffect residents of color and low-income residents. Inherited properties can have title issues, which in some cases, are a product \nof generations of systemic exclusion from financial and legal systems. Due to various racial and economic disparities, land \nretention and wealth acquisition are inhibited for some households due to property title issues.  \nResearch suggests that by 2045, during the Great Wealth Transfer, an estimated $84 trillion will be transferred from the Baby \nBoomer generation to younger generations in the United States.7 If significant solutions are not implemented to address the \nracial wealth gap, inequality will continue to widen. The racial wealth gap is projected to result in White households owning 99 \ntimes more than their Black counterparts and 75 times more than their Latino counterparts by 2053.8   \nThe transfer of property ownership across generations is one of many factors contributing to generational wealth. Households \nthat do not have estate planning or that own properties affected by title issues will not be able to access their generational \nwealth, thus potentially having greater impacts on the racial wealth gap. Research from Consumer Reports estimates that 61 \npercent of Whites, 67 percent of Asian-Americans, 77 percent of Blacks, and 82 percent of Hispanics do not have a will.9   \nAccess to homeownership and ensuring that property owners have full agency to make housing decisions and acquire \ngenerational wealth is foundational to this research. The Housing Assistance Council (HAC), in partnership with Fannie Mae, \ndeveloped a quantitative methodology to estimate the relative prevalence of title issues, including heirs’ properties and tangled \ntitles. Identifying and addressing title issues can inform strategies and solutions to support affected households. \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 9 of 50 \nHeirs’ Property Land Retention \nThe Pathway to Property Ownership and Land Retention Has Been Exclusionary Throughout U.S. History  \nSystemic racism has impacted access to homeownership and land retention for residents of color in the United States. Originally, \nonly White males had property rights. Further, the country viewed enslaved Black Americans as property and sought to protect \nthe enslavers’ “rights” to enslave others.10 When slavery was outlawed, Black families pursued homeownership and built \ncommunities, but they faced continued violence.11 Many factors and events, including racially motivated violence, the Great \nMigration, and systemic discrimination, led to significant land loss for Black residents.12, 13 Research estimated that between 1865 \nand 1910, Black residents acquired 15 million acres of land.14 By 1969, the estimated total of Black-owned land fell to \napproximately 5.5 million, and by 2001, an estimated 80 percent of that land was lost.15  \nIn some Black communities, communal and familial land control provides communities of kinship tied to the land.16 Historically, \nland ownership in the U.S. has been tied to political agency, particularly beginning in the era of Jim Crow Laws.17 Owning property \nalso provided personal power, housing security, and protection from homelessness. Communal and familial land control has \nbeen used as a means for inclusion and protection for some Black families.18 Indigenous communities, Black Americans, and \nother residents of color have overcome generations of systemic racism to become property owners and continue to seek financial \nstability and wealth generation.19 \n Another example of how heirs’ properties affect communities of color can be seen through the ‘Fractionation’ of some tribal \nlands within indigenous communities, as a result of the General Allotment Act of 1887. When a Native American allottee dies, the \ntitle is divided amongst all their heirs. The number of owners grows exponentially via heirship, resulting in increasingly \nfractionated land ownership. Fractional ownership creates issues with land use and the ability to access income and wealth from \nthe land.20  \nDue to the design of the country’s financial and legal systems, collective and familial land control presents challenges for the \nowners. The financial and legal systems prioritize private and individual land ownership, resulting in a lack of owner agency, \naccess to needed financing, and market participation for owners of fractionated property. Commonly referred to as heirs’ \nproperty and tangled titles, properties with multiple owners without a clear title may have financial and legal complications.  \nThe design of the financial and legal system and compounded effects of systemic disinvestment impact low-income and rural \nhouseholds of all races and ethnicities. Rural communities are ten times more likely to not have access to in-person banking \nservices in comparison to urban areas. The Federal Reserve identified 2,100 banking deserts, where communities lacked access to \na physical bank, 1,500 of which are in rural areas.21 In rural Appalachia, where 87.5 percent of residents are White non-Hispanic, \nthe poverty rate is 19.7 percent, compared to non-Appalachian rural poverty rate of 15.1 percent and the nation’s poverty rate of \n11.6 percent.22, 23   \nLow-income and rural communities report inadequate access to legal help. Research from the Legal Services Corporation reports \nthat low-income residents in the country reported not receiving any or enough legal assistance for 92 percent of their civil legal \nproblems.24 Civil legal problems include housing, providing for their families, and other problems often related to essential needs. \nWhile 77 percent of rural households had one or more legal issues in a one-year period, rural residents reported not receiving any \nor enough legal assistance for 94 percent of their civil legal issues. Approximately 21 percent of rural residents sought legal help \nfor substantial legal issues.25 Rural residents are also disproportionately located in legal deserts, defined as a county with fewer \nthan one attorney per 1,000 residents.26 Approximately 2 percent of law practices are in rural areas.27 \nResearchers suggest that the prevalence of heirs’ property increases with systemic disinvestment and lack of access.28 In some \nlow-income and rural regions, persistent poverty, and lack of access to financial institutions and the legal system also impact \nrates of title issues, the prevalence of heirs’ property, and wealth generation.29, 30 \nHeirs’ Property Can Be Created When a Property Owner Dies Without a Form of Estate Planning  \nHeirs’ property can be created when an owner dies without a will or another form of estate planning. This type of property is \ntransferred to heirs in joint ownership, usually called tenancy in common.31 If the title is not cleared, the property continues to \npass to additional heirs through generations. The heirs have claims to the property but may not be the current residents.  \nRegions with predominantly Black residents, Native American households, and households with lower economic standing \nexperience barriers when seeking estate planning. Estate planning can be costly and requires the use of legal professionals. After \ngenerations of systemic harm through the legal system, some households of color are wary of engaging with the legal system.32  \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 10 of 50 \nDue to generations of exclusion from property ownership pathways, legal systems, and financial systems, certain households \nfrequently found alternate means of acquiring property and preserving land for future generations.33 Barriers to engaging in \nformal estate planning, which contributes to the creation of heirs’ property, disproportionately affecting rural regions, low-\nincome communities, Black and Native American households, and other communities of color.34 \nProperties With Wills and Estate Planning Can Also Become Heirs’ Property \nIn some cases, property owners complete estate planning and choose to leave their properties to multiple descendants.35 The \noriginal property owners may have undergone estate planning, but for a variety of reasons, the formal title transfer to the new \nowners was not completed.36 The probate process through the local courts is a necessary step for most properties upon the death \nof the owner. The result is a “tangled title”.37 Owners of these properties also face challenges accessing the full equity and \nresources for their homes.38  \nForms of familial and communal land control have cultural and historical significance for some communities. Emotional ties to \nland and the connection between kinship and land ownership are part of the reason an owner may choose familial land control \nand make a will that leaves the property to multiple descendants.39  \nHeirs’ Property Owners Face Many Barriers Without Access to a Clear Title \nA clear title is required to access many financial resources for repairs or other common needs. Unable to repair the property, \naccess equity, or sell the property, the owners’ housing journey becomes stagnated. After a disaster, heirs’ property owners are \noften required to submit proof of ownership to access disaster recovery funding. As an example, following Hurricane Katrina, 5 \npercent of applications were denied by FEMA because of title issues.40 For other unforeseen events, heirs’ properties cannot be \ninsured without a title. A clear title is also required for sale at market value. Inability to access loans and grants for repair and \nupkeep may result in property loss, loss of generational wealth, abandonment, and community blight.41  \nJoint ownership of property leads to other issues of land control. Changes cannot be made to the property without written \nconsensus among all living heirs.42 Heirs who are not residents of the property may sell their share in a partition sale, in some \ninstances, to developers. In some states, once a developer has acquired majority ownership, the developer can sue the remaining \nheirs to sell their ownership, called a forced sale.43 Forced sales are significantly below market value, resulting in a loss of wealth \nfor the family, and may result in displacement, even homelessness, for the property residents.44  \nLow-income residents face many barriers in clearing a title and completing the probate process. The process can be time-\nconsuming and expensive, requiring legal attention and court proceedings.45 The necessary legal assistance can be costly, \nparticularly if mediation is required, and court fees are additional costs. The process is further complicated by the necessity to \nlocate numerous potential heirs.46  \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 11 of 50 \nApproach \n \n \n \nPhoto: Shawn Poynter. – There is more Work to Be Done \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 12 of 50 \nApproach \nHAC, in Partnership With Fannie Mae, Conducted a Quantitative Analysis to Estimate the Prevalence Of Heirs’ Properties  \nFor this analysis, HAC used county tax assessment data provided by Fannie Mae via ICE Mortgage Technology, Inc. (ICE). The \nresearch aimed to use previously accepted regional methodologies on the national scale to identify regions with a high \nprevalence of heirs’ property. HAC conducted demographic analyses of counties with an estimated high prevalence of heirs’ \nproperty with data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). Data from the ACS was not used in the \nspecific heirs’ identification and estimation process. \nThe Estimation Process Considered Past Research and Efforts to Enumerate Heirs’ Properties  \nPrevious research on heirs’ property has incorporated property owner and community demographics such as race and ethnicity, \neducation, and income. Specific property characteristics have also included assessment and deed data regarding recent sales, \nbuilding quality, and mortgage amounts. Research has explored agricultural parcels, vacant land, and residential properties \nthrough a variety of data sources to estimate the scope of the issue. The Federation of Southern Cooperatives, considered \npioneers in heirs’ research, advocacy, and resolution, conducted one of the first heirs’ research studies, commissioned by \nCongress in 1980.47 Researchers from the then-named Emergency Land Fund, collaborated with tax assessors, tax collectors, \ncircuit clerks, and other local professionals and residents to identify Black owned parcels. Once all Black-owned parcels were \nidentified, researchers contacted each owner to verify the owners’ race, address, and ownership status. Then, using a random \nsampling method, parcels were selected. Tax records were referenced for the size of the parcel and details of ownership.  \nInterviews were conducted with the owners of the selected parcels to confirm heirship and estimate the prevalence of heirs’ \nproperty. Researchers identified 27 percent of parcels and 41 percent of acreage as heirs’ property.48  \nProperty Records, Tax Records, and Death Records Contain Indications of Heirship in Owner Characteristics \nSince the research by the Emergency Land Fund, researchers have continued to explore methodologies focused on owner \ncharacteristics to estimate the prevalence of heirs’ property in regions across the country.  \nDyer, Bailey, and Tran (2008) identified parcels in heirship status in Macon County, Alabama, using property tax records. \nResearchers located parcels for which the taxpayer account name included indicators of heirship in the Collections and Account \nStatus reports of the Revenue Commissioners’ tax information. The initial analysis identified 2,313 (9.6 percent) accounts \npotentially in heirship. Filtering for active accounts resulted in a final estimate of 1,516 parcels likely to be heirs’ property, \ncomprising 4.1 percent of the acreage in the county.49  \nJohnson Gaither (2017) conducted an estimation of heirs’ properties in colonias in Maverick County, Texas. Indicators of multiple \nowners in the owners’ name column of the taxed parcel database from BIS Consulting in Farmer’s Branch, Texas, were used to \nidentify properties in heirship. Properties with “multiple owners,” “undivided interest,” and percentages or fractions of interest \nwere classified as heirs’ property. Johnson Gaither identified 186 (0.7 percent) heirs’ property parcels in the county. Of the 9,113 \nparcels in the county’s colonias, 37 (0.4 percent) were identified as heirs’ properties.50 \nThe Southern Region Heirs Property Collaborative (2021) also used name indicators and associated abbreviations on records in \nthe local County Revenue Commissioner’s Office to identify parcels potentially in heirship status. Researchers selected counties in \nAlabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, and Florida, based on population demographics and other factors, including data \navailability. Researchers identified 7,559 parcels (4.6 percent) across ten counties in Alabama, 4,557 (7.9 percent) parcels in five \ncounties in Mississippi, 2,176 (5.2 percent) in four parishes in Louisiana, 21,320 (3.3 percent) in ten counties in Texas, and 3,377 \n(4.2 percent) in eight Georgia counties, and 3,758 parcels in eleven counties in Florida. Computer-assisted mass appraisal (CAMA) \ndata were used in Florida and Georgia due to data consistency and availability issues.51  \nA Pew Charitable Trusts report identified tangled titles by identifying properties in Philadelphia recorded in the name of a \ndeceased owner. Hinken et al. (2021) used Social Security Administration death records. Researchers identified 10,407 properties \nwith a surviving record owner who did not automatically receive ownership and properties with no surviving record owners. \nCompared to the 2007 Philadelphia VIP study which identified 14,001 (2 percent) tangled titles, this research used a stricter \ndefinition of tangled titles. Philadelphia VIP assumed any property not sold since 1941 had a tangled title and, for properties with \nsales after 1971, only one owner’s death was confirmed, in comparison to all owners in the 2021 study.52  \nUsing 2021 Name-Address-Legal (NAL) real property tax roll data from the Florida Department of Revenue, Stein and Carpenter \n(2022), with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, identified heirs’ properties by owner names that included indication of heirs’ \nproperty. In Duval County, Florida, researchers identified 29,389 (9.2 percent) residential parcels likely to be in heirship status.53 \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 13 of 50 \nMost recently, Dobbs and Johnson Gaither (2023), used owner name indicators to estimate the prevalence of heirs’ property \nparcels across the nation.54 Using LightBox data from the USDA Forest Service from November 2021, Dobbs and Johnson Gaither \nidentified 444,172 heirs’ property parcels across the country with a total combined worth of $41.3 billion.55  \n \nSome Private Data Resources Contain Properties Flagged as Heirs’ Property \nMultiple researchers state that access to complete data is a primary challenge associated with estimating the prevalence of heirs’ \nproperties. In addition to investigating owner characteristics, other researchers have procured private data sets which include \nproperties flagged as known heirs’ property. Using the 2012-2016 CoreLogic Real Estate Dataset, researchers analyzed properties \nflagged as heirs’ property in various geographic regions.56 This data included residential properties and excluded agricultural \nland.  \nCarpenter, Jones, and Pippin (2016) with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta focused on the southeast region, looking at \nestimates in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Across the six states, 85,607 (0.5 \npercent) of properties were flagged as heirs’ properties or were owned by tenants in common. Other properties were identified as \npotentially in heirship, with 239,368 (1.3 percent) identified as life estates and 107,175 (0.6 percent) identified as estates.57  \nTaylor, Johnson Gaither, et al. (2020) estimated the prevalence of heirs’ property using CoreLogic data and parcel records from \nDigital Maps Products. Researchers also noted significant omissions in the data. Across three states, Alabama, Georgia, and \nKentucky, 62,806 (0.6 percent) parcels were identified as heirs’ property.58  \nCarpenter and Ravindranath Waddell (2021) with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond stated that inconsistencies and \nomissions in the data could not produce an overall estimate. The prevalence of heirs’ property in Virginia and Maryland ranged \nfrom 0.03 to 3.3 percent.59 \nProperty and Tax Records Contain Indications of Heirship Property Characteristics \nOther research assessed property characteristics and demographic data to identify heirs’ properties.  \nGeorgia Appleseed used tax records and Superior Court land records to identify properties with specific characteristics. Using two \nrounds of data analysis, researchers conducted an in-depth analysis of the electronic county tax assessor records for 20 selected \ncounties. Tax parcel cards were analyzed for homeowner and property information, including address, land value and \nimprovement, acreage, and owner name. Properties were considered to potentially be heirs’ property if they had low land value, \nno recent sales, no recent improvements, and a different mailing address from the property address. Round two of the research \nfocused on five selected counties. Researchers compared tax assessor records and Superior Court land records from the Georgia \nSuperior Court Clerks Authority website to confirm heirship status for the parcels identified in round one. Researchers identified \n1,620 (0.9 percent) heirs’ property parcels across the five selected counties in Georgia.60   \nIn 2017, Pippin, Jones, and Johnson Gaither, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, identified counties for analysis using U.S. \nCensus Bureau demographic data, the Social Vulnerability Index, and natural hazard and disaster data from the Forest Service \nSouthern Region. Indicators for each county included a high percentage of racial and ethnic minority populations, high poverty \nrates, low per capita income, and low educational attainment.61 CAMA data were used to analyze parcels in selected counties \nusing characteristics of ownership by natural people, no preferential tax status, and older transfer dates as indicators of a lack of \ngood title. Approximately 19 percent of all parcels in selected Georgia counties were identified as heirs’ property. Across the five \nselected counties in the Black Belt region, 34,463 acres, an average of 4 percent of each county’s area, were identified as heirs’ \nproperty.62  \nThomson and Bailey (2023) used CoreLogic data to estimate the prevalence of heirs’ property in the southeast and Appalachia.63 \nFocusing on eleven states, researchers used four indicators: ownership rights, “care of” in the owners’ name, year built, and no \nsale in 29 years in their methodology. If properties had four points out of a possible five points, based on the indicators, they were \nidentified as heirs' property. This research identified 496,994 heirs’ parcels, with a combined estimated market value of $41.9 \nbillion.64 \nIndicators of a Caretaker and No Recent Sale are Strong Predictors of Heirs’ Properties \nJohnson Gaither and Zarnoch (2017) focused their research on heirs’ properties in Leslie County, Kentucky, and Macon-Bibb \nCounty, Georgia. The counties were selected to enable comparison of a rural and an urban county with available relevant data \nsets. For Leslie County, taxed land parcel data were obtained from the Property Valuation Administrator’s Office. Parcels were \nindicated “heirs’ of” in the owner name variable which allowed for identification of heirs’ properties. Macon-Bibb County tax \nparcel CAMA data were acquired from the University of Georgia’s Carl Vinson Institute of Government Office of Information \nTechnology Outreach Services. The data also included a notation of “heirs” in the owner name to identify heirs’ properties. The \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 14 of 50 \nstudy did not report the prevalence of heirs’ property; rather, the researchers tested the predictive strength of other demographic \nindicators in identifying heirship.65  \nResearchers found that the greatest concentrations of heirs’ parcels were in census block groups with high concentrations of \nBlack residents, higher proportions of residents below poverty, and lower educational attainment. Using an Ordinary Least \nSquares (OLS) regression, the proportion of the population without a diploma was the most strongly correlated with the \nconcentration of heirs’ property. Researchers suggest that heirs’ properties emerge from areas with social marginalization.66 \nResearchers also used logistic models to analyze the predictive value of tax assessment indicators, including properties with a \nlower per acre value, a caretaker, no sale within 30 years, and an owner’s mailing address in a different state than the property. \nIndicators of a caretaker and no sale in the last 30 years were strong predictors of heirship. The accuracy of using those two \nindicators in identifying heirs’ property was reported as 67 percent in Leslie County. In Macon-Bibb, using the same indicators, \nparcels were identified with an accuracy rate of 48 percent. In both counties, the predictive model also included false positives.67  \nEstimates of the Prevalence of Heirs’ Property Vary by Methodology and Region  \nEstimates of the prevalence of heirs’ property in various counties have ranged from 0.03 percent to 9.6 percent of residential \nproperties.68, 69 The variations in estimates across research can be attributed to the fluidity of real estate, data sources, data \navailability, and variations in data collection across localities.70, 71 Often to the detriment of the owners, heirs’ properties can be \ncleared over time. Through forced sales, tax delinquency, foreclosure, and other methods of property loss, properties with title \nissues in the past may have a clear title today. Heirs’ property is not a static issue as the fluidity of the real estate market demands \nwill cause the scope of the problem to fluctuate over time.72  \nVariations in methodology, including using the characteristics of those responsible for paying taxes (assessees), community \ndemographics, property characteristics, and owners’ deaths have been used to estimate heirs’ properties. Researchers have also \nused units of acreage, land parcels, and residential properties. Data used in prior research included agricultural land, vacant \nproperty, and occupied residential properties. The variation in methodology often inhibits the ability to make direct comparison \nbetween different research studies and models. All researchers, regardless of their methodology or data source, state that the \nvariability and incomplete nature of the data produces conservative estimates. \nHAC Conducted Research Informed by Prior Research \nHAC aims to highlight regions with a relatively higher prevalence of heirs’ property and contribute research observations to the \nfield by applying prior regional research methodologies to all counties in the nation. Given the observations of all prior research \nregarding data availability, HAC used both owner and property characteristics to determine the prevalence of heirs’ property. \nUsing county tax assessment and deed data provided by Fannie Mae via ICE Mortgage Technology, Inc., informed by prior \nresearch, and in collaboration with Fannie Mae’s Enterprise Data Team, HAC determined which variables were reliable for \nnational analysis. \nHAC’s use of owner characteristics was similar to that employed by Dyer et al. (2008). However, given the repeatedly noted issue \nof nonuniformity in data, it can be assumed that such terms will not be used in every heirs’ property tax record and therefore this \nmethod alone will produce very conservative results.  \nHAC also used property characteristics in the methodology, including the lack of recent sales, which was determined by Johnson \nGaither et al. as a strong predictive indicator of heirs’ property.73 Georgia Appleseed and other researchers noted that incomplete \nproperty characteristics data also results in conservative estimates.74  \nThe research analyzes residential properties across the country. The data set does not include vacant residential properties or \nagricultural land. All estimates presented in this research are conservative.  \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 15 of 50 \nMethods \n \n \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 16 of 50 \nMethods \nThe Estimation Process Incorporated Both Owner and Property Characteristics to Identify Potential Heirs’ Property \nHAC aimed to create a methodology that would capture the fluidity of heirs’ property as well as possible on a national scale given \ndata uniformity and availability issues. In this approach, researchers aimed to estimate the prevalence of two classifications of \nproperties: those that are most likely heirs’ properties and properties that are at risk of currently being in heirship or may soon \nbecome heirs’ property. Methodology was implemented to estimate the relative prevalence of two classifications: Most Likely \nHeirs’ Property and At Risk of Being Heirs’ Property.  \n \nMost Likely Heirs’ Property \nProperties included in this classification have an indication of transfer of ownership upon the owner’s death without completing \nprobate and the formal transfer of title.  \nProperties without Indications of Formal Title Transfer in Owner Characteristics were Selected \nProperties with terms in the assessee/owner name which indicated a transfer of ownership upon the owners’ death without \nprobate were identified. The use of this terminology is not standard practice across the country. This research selected the \nterminology that was most commonly used in tax assessment data to signify that the owner had passed away and the property \nhad not completed the formal title transfer process.  \nProperties with Vesting Codes which Signify Ownership by Multiple Real Persons were Selected  \nWhen analyzing the data set, researchers noticed there were properties that contained indications of estate planning, but the \nproperty had not undergone probate. Using the assessee/owner vesting codes, the research model identified properties most \nlikely to be in heirship status due to having tangled titles. Vesting codes identify how the property was transferred from the \nformer owner to the current owner(s). Researchers also noticed a subset of the tangled title properties with indicators of estate \nplanning that may signify that the deceased owner may have chosen a form of familial land control, but the property may not \nhave undergone probate or the legal ownership transfer. \nThe research team also analyzed the owner vesting codes to include only properties owned by multiple real persons. Properties \nwith vesting codes such as “corporation,” “doing business as,” “government,” and “partnership” were excluded. Also excluded \nwere properties with vesting codes that signified sole ownership, joint tenants, living trusts, or a transfer to a spouse.  \n \nAt Risk of Being Heirs’ Property \nHAC analyzed property characteristics to identify properties with indicators aligned with a lack of clear title. Due to variation \nacross localities in reporting deceased homeowners and updating owner/assessee information, using name indicators may \nsignificantly misrepresent the prevalence of the issues. To better represent the relative prevalence of heirs’ properties, the \nresearchers also analyzed property characteristics associated with a lack of clear title. The indicators included no recorded sale in \n30 years, no full tax exemptions, low building quality and condition, and no mortgage amount. Properties with all four \ncharacteristics were labeled at risk of being heirs’ property.  \nIn the following section, the research findings are reported separately for each category, at risk and most likely, then combined \nfor all identified properties.  \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 17 of 50 \nEstimate of Properties At Risk of Being Heirs’ Property \nThe At Risk Category Identified Properties Using Characteristics That May Demonstrate the Presence of Title Issues \nThe properties identified in this category are at risk of already being in heirship status or soon becoming heirs’ property without \nintervention. This classification was included to highlight regions that may need targeted interventions and to identify properties \nthat may be in heirship status but located in regions that do not adhere to the owner naming assessment systems. The estimates \nincluded in this classification included a range and are not exact estimates. The estimates provided are intended to highlight \nregions with a relatively high prevalence of heirs’ properties or the potential for heirs’ properties.  \nAdditional Adjustments Were Implemented to Minimize Anomalous Results in the At Risk Category   \nThroughout the research process, some states produced anomalous results where the at risk property prevalence differed greatly \nfrom the most likely prevalence. Because the most likely heirs’ category has specific indicators of multi-person ownership, it was \nused as the baseline. States were ranked by quintile based on the prevalence of their most likely and at risk identified properties. \nAs demonstrated in Table 1, states that had a two-quartile or more difference between the two categories were not included in \nthe analysis. Those states were Kansas, Maryland, New York, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The properties identified in these \nstates were omitted from the estimate and associated analysis.  \n \nTable 1. Quartiles for States Omitted from At Risk Analysis \nState \nMost Likely Quintile \nAt Risk Quintile \nDifference in \nQuintile \nKansas \n1 \n4 \n3 \nMaryland \n4 \n0 \n4 \nNew York \n3 \n0 \n3 \nVermont \n4 \n1 \n3 \nWisconsin \n4 \n0 \n4 \nWyoming \n1 \n4 \n3 \n \nPast researchers focused on the southeast used these characteristics to identify at risk properties because they were considered \nto be anomalous for properties in the region, and thus indications of a lack of clear title. In some regions and states, including the \nstates omitted from this portion of the analysis, low rates of new mortgages, lower housing stock quality, and infrequent sales \nwere more common. The research team believed that in those places those factors demonstrated housing quality issues and \nlending deserts rather than indicating properties at risk of being in heirship status.  \nWhen analyzing three of the indicators, mortgage, sale date, and tax exemption, researchers included properties that did not \nhave data reported. The data set did not have an indicator to determine whether properties had data missing or if the property \ndid not have the associated characteristics. The research proceeded by assuming that no data meant the property did not have \nthe characteristic, and were considered at risk of being heirs’ property.  \nData availability issues, including the presence of physical versus electronic data in some localities, affected the results of this \nmethodology. Localized research is needed in these states to identify properties at risk of being heirs’ property. Further analysis \nof each variable used in the at-risk category is included in the discussion section. \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 18 of 50 \nEstimates of At Risk Properties Were Highly Sensitive to Housing Quality and Condition \nThe methodology used four characteristics to identify properties at risk: no mortgage, no recent sale, building quality and \ncondition, and no full tax exemptions. In conversation with practitioners and assessors, researchers learned that the assessment \nof building quality and conditions varies by locality. In some localities, the measure of excellent, average, poor, and unsound \nbuilding quality and condition is relative to other housing stock. In other regions, the building quality is assessed in relation to the \ndate the home was built. Assessors consider the year the home was built and determine the quality of the home in relation to the \nexpected condition of a home of that age.  \nConsidering the variation in the assessment of building quality and condition, researchers began the research process by \nanalyzing properties with no sale within the last 30 years, full tax assessment, or mortgage, and non-excellent building quality. \nThe initial results identified 50 percent or more of all residential properties in 31 states. Ten states had 80 percent or more of \nproperties in this category. The results demonstrated other macro housing issues but did not solely isolate properties at risk of \nheirship. \nQualitative exploration in Kansas suggested that missing data, specific local assessment procedures regarding building quality \nand condition, and the quality of local housing stock may result in inflated results for the at-risk properties. Researchers aimed to \ntest the sensitivity of the variables with the available data. Three of the variables used identified properties based on the absence \nof the characteristic; the lack of mortgage, lack of full tax exemption, and lack of a recent sale. Given the nature of the three \naforementioned variables, the only variable that could be used for sensitivity testing was building quality/ condition.  \nResearchers tested the methodology with a filter for average or lower housing quality and condition. The “middle range housing \nquality” included properties with average to unsound housing quality and condition. After applying the indicator, the total \nnumber of identified properties was 3,713,350. This is not the final estimate used for analysis. Although title issues can occur in \nhousing of any quality and condition, this at-risk methodology was intended to capture older properties in which other indicators \nof multi-person ownership were not otherwise present.  \nResearchers adjusted the methodology to identify properties with no mortgage, no full tax assessment, no recent sale and \nassessed as poor or unsound quality. The methodology resulted in a conservative estimate of 491,537 (0.5 percent) properties at \nrisk of being heirs’ property.  \nAdditional data and localized research are needed to estimate properties at risk of being heirs’ property. Data that separates \nmissing data from null, i.e., including “0” for mortgage amounts separate from an indicator for no mortgage data available, would \nproduce more accurate results. Additionally, local context for the assessment process for building quality and condition is needed \nfor the estimation process.  \n \nUltimately, the Research Model Estimated the Prevalence of “At Risk Heirs” Using the Most Conservative Model \nResearchers concluded that there are, at minimum, 491,537 properties in the U.S. at risk of being heirs’ property. The research \nanalysis focuses primarily on relative prevalence for further understanding of the issue. However, it is important to acknowledge \nthat data variability and availability produced very conservative results that do not reflect the magnitude of the issue. \nThe analysis categorized the prevalence of heirs’ properties by county. The percentages were calculated using the total number of \nresidential properties in ICE’s data at the time of the study.  \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 19 of 50 \nMap 1.

These properties were classified as most \nlikely to be in heirship status and represent 0.1 percent of residential properties in the 44 states included in the analysis and the \nDistrict of Columbia. To the researchers’ knowledge, the methodology of using both terminologies in the owner/assessee name \nand filtering by vesting codes is one of the more conservative methodologies used in heirs’ research to date, thus producing very \nconservative estimates. Using the terminology in the owner/assessee name is not a uniform practice in property tax assessment \nand parcels with missing data affected these estimates. This section presents an analysis of the properties identified in the most \nlikely category.  \nNorth Carolina and Florida each had more than 10,000 properties identified in the most likely heirs’ property category. Five of the \nten states with the most properties identified in this category are in the southeastern U.S., which contains two high-need regions: \nCentral Appalachia and the Lower Mississippi Delta.75 West Virginia and Alabama had the highest percentages of properties in the \nmost likely category. While there is some overlap between the states with the highest number of identified properties and states \nwith the greatest prevalence, Georgia and California are in the top ten for total properties but not for percent. Inversely, Iowa has \nthe sixth highest percentage of properties but is not in the top ten of total properties estimated.  \n \nTable 2.

For the purposes of conducting \na comparative analysis, the prevalence of heirs’ property was categorized into five general classifications: \n▪ \nVery low prevalence: Counties with no identified heirs’ property. \n▪ \nLow prevalence: Counties with one or more identified heirs’ property, but with a prevalence of less than or equal to 0.3 \npercent. \n▪ \nModerate prevalence: Counties with a prevalence of heirs’ property.  \ngreater than 0.3 percent but less than or equal to 0.8 percent. \n▪ \nHigh prevalence: Counties with a prevalence of heirs’ property greater than 0.8 percent but less than or equal to 2.3 \npercent \n▪ \nVery high prevalence: Counties with a prevalence of heirs’ property of more than 2.3 percent.  \n \nPersistent Poverty Counties Have Disproportionately High Rates of Heirs’ Property \nThe issue of poverty is complex, but it is much more than an abstract condition for the over 37 million Americans who face daily \nstruggles with food insecurity, access to health care, and search for basic shelter.

The total assessed values represent the properties in their current state. In some cases, the total assessed value is a \nmisrepresentation of the inaccessible wealth and equity associated with the identified properties.

This estimate is undoubtedly less than the true scope of wealth tied up in heirs’ properties across the country. \nThe research estimate is an undercount in each state included, and six states, including states with high property values like New \nYork, are not included in this analysis due to data issues.

Informed by \ndiscussions with the assessors and an analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, HAC recognized that regions with \nlow rates of new mortgage loans, low quality housing stock, or high proportions of residents remaining in their homes for a long \ntime with minimal sales skewed the data. \nThe lack of a mortgage is one of the filters for the properties identified as being at risk of being in heirship status.  One thing to \nnote is that in many rural areas, for example the rural southeast and Great Plains, the limited volume of mortgage lending may be \nmore reflective of the general housing market and community dynamics than it is of heirs’ property prevalence or risk. This \nmeans the indicator may overstate at-risk heirs' properties in certain rural areas. The lack of a mortgage is, however, a condition \nthat is closely associated with heirs’ property, and thus, it must be considered in assessing risk. Efforts to identify additional \nqualifiers could refine this measure.  \nProperties with no reported sale were assumed to have not been sold since construction. For properties with no reported sale, \nthe methodology filtered for properties with a reported year built of 30 years or older. The lack of new construction in rural and \neconomically distressed areas may overstate heirs' property risk when, as is the case with mortgage lending activity, it primarily \nreflects market conditions, not property title problems.   \nThe research methodology also used poor housing quality and condition as an indicator that a property may be at risk of being \nheirs’ property. According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 2.8 million properties were classified as \nmoderately or severely inadequate in 2021.80 Research suggests that using HUD’s definition of moderately or severely inadequate \nexcludes properties that, though classified as adequate, are in poor condition. The 3.4 percent of owner-occupied housing in the \ncountry considered moderately or severely inadequate will affect the efficacy of housing quality as a measure of heirship.81 The \nresearch methodology uses poor housing quality and condition as one of the indicators of heirs’ property. In regions with a high \nprevalence of poor housing quality, the measure may not be as reliable in isolating heirs’ property.  \nIn some regions, properties with no recent sale, no mortgage, and low housing quality are the norm, not the anomaly. The \nresearch methodology eliminated properties that had characteristics aligned with having a clear title. After eliminating them, \nresearchers labeled the remaining properties as at risk of being in heirship status. In some regions, this elimination process \nresulted in identifying most properties in the region instead of solely including anomalous properties at risk of being heirs’ \nproperty. Inversely, there were states with a high prevalence of properties most likely to be in heirship, but significantly lower \nrates of properties in the at risk of heirship category.  \nResearchers, in collaboration with Fannie Mae Enterprise Data Team, sought additional data to refine the estimates. One variable \nused in prior research is whether the mailing address for the owner matched the address of the property. Qualitative research \nsuggests that in some cases, the owners of an heirs’ property may not reside in the property. In the available data, however, 94.5 \npercent of properties were missing zip codes. As a result, properties with differing zip codes comprised less than 0.1 percent of all \nresidential properties. Using addresses was not an option for this research. Further localized research is needed in these places to \ninclude regional specific characteristics of properties in heirship forms of ownership.  \n \nTable 10.

Tax assessment and deed data collection occurs on the county level and is compiled and aggregated by \nICE. Because the data was collected on a county level, there were variations in data across counties and states. Historically, land \ntitle and assessment data was not collected electronically.82 In some counties, older records are still held in physical copies even if \nthe current assessment system is electronic. In some cases, there were variations at the individual assessor recording level within \ncounties. HAC, in collaboration with Fannie Mae’s Enterprise Data Team, determined which variables were reliable for a national \nanalysis.  \nThe Estimates of Heirs’ Properties for This Study are Conservative \nDue to the variation in tax assessment data collection in each county, the research employed indicators in the methodology that \nwere most common across the nation. One goal of this research is to create a reproducible methodology that municipalities can \nuse in their regions, with the addition of unique regional indicators for heirs’ properties, deceased owners, and transfer of \nownership without probate. The results of this research demonstrate relative prevalence and provide estimates as a baseline for \ncounties to add unique identifiers to locate additional properties. Additionally, prior research demonstrates that heirs’ properties \nmay be vacant land and agricultural property. The data used in this research includes only residential properties and does not \ninclude parcels that were zoned as residential but were vacant at the time of the last assessment.  \nThe research team had access to a robust national data set but, due to differences in data collection and availability across \nlocalities, missing data also produced more conservative results. An analysis of the data used to identify properties at risk of \nbeing in heirship demonstrated the magnitude of missing data. Data for the variable building quality were missing for 56 percent \nof properties, and building condition were also missing for 56 percent of properties. Latest sale data were missing for more than \none-third of properties and, although not having a sale recorded was used as a possible indication of heirship, the data did not \nallow distinction between missing data or lack of a recent sale. \nThe Methodology for this Research Focused Primarily on Property Tax Assessment Data \nICE Mortgage Technology, Inc. and the U.S. Census differ in their data collection methodology and classifications for properties \nper county and census tract. To align the data for analysis, HAC relied on ICE’s data and property counts. The ICE data set used for \nthis analysis was updated in October 2022. The HAC findings are a present snapshot of the prevalence of heirs’ property. The \nCensus Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 2021 five-year data were used for a demographic analysis of the counties. \nGiven the fluidity of properties with title issues, the results presented may vary based on the time of collection of the data.  \nVariation in Data Collection Impacts Comparative Studies  \nThe variation in tax assessment data has been noted in prior research, and in some cases, led to researchers selecting regions of \nfoci based on the availability of data. Additionally, other researchers have noted that the variability of assessment data across \ncounties and states led to region-specific studies due to the inapplicability of the methodology across multiple regions. HAC \naimed to create a methodology to demonstrate the relative prevalence of heirs’ properties across all counties in the country. Due \nto the national scale of this research and approach to the methodology, there are minimal opportunities for a comparative \nanalysis of results to prior research. \nDifferences in Methodological Approaches and Data Access Yield Differing Results Across Research Studies  \nHeirs’ property is a fluid issue that is demonstrated and documented differently based on the locality. Researchers engaged in a \ncomparative analysis of results with the consideration that the date the research was conducted, the methodology used, and the \ndata source all impact the estimates. Additionally, researchers conducted a national analysis, which differs from prior localized \nresearch. Researchers focused on prior studies with some similarities in methodologies and one study with a different \nmethodology.  \nDyer, Bailey, and Tran (2008) identified parcels in heirship status in Macon County, Alabama, by identifying indicators of a \ndeceased owner on record using local property tax records. The initial analysis identified 2,313 (9.6 percent) accounts potentially \nin heirship. Filtering for active accounts resulted in a final estimate of 1,516 parcels likely to be in heirship, comprising 4.1 percent \nof the acreage in the county.83 HAC identified properties, in contrast to accounts and acreage. HAC’s estimate for Macon County \nfor both categories was 7.4 percent of all properties. A total of 232 properties were identified, which is not the same measure as \ntax accounts.  \nJohnson Gaither (2017) estimated heirs’ properties in Maverick County, Texas, using indicators of “multiple owners,” “undivided \ninterest,” and percentages or fractions of interest in the owner’s name of a regional tax database. Johnson Gaither identified 186 \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 37 of 50 \n(0.7 percent) heirs’ property parcels in the county.84 HAC, using a similar but more conservative methodology, estimated one \nproperty.  \nSimilarly, Stein and Carpenter, with the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, used a state tax roll, which included vacant land, and \nidentified 29,389 (9.2 percent) residential parcels likely to be in heirship status in Duval County, Florida.85 HAC’s methodology was \nmore conservative with the addition of the vesting code filter and removal of “estate” from the identification process. In some \nregions, “estate” is an indication of heirship, but that is not a universal assessment practice. In some localities, estate signifies a \nform of estate planning and not heirship status. Additionally, the national data set did not include vacant properties. HAC, using a \nsimilar methodology, identified 723 (0.2 percent) heirs’ properties in Duval County in the most likely category. The total combined \nestimate for Duval County was 2,720 (0.8 percent) properties. As demonstrated in the table below, there were significant \ndifferences in the results when using similar methodologies but differing data – a local data or national. \nPew Charitable Trusts used death records to identify 10,407 heirs’ properties, which was 2 percent of properties in Philadelphia \nCounty, Pennsylvania.86 When comparing HAC’s results of 619 (0.1 percent) properties, a few data points stood out. When \nassessing the building quality, zero properties were assessed below “C-” rating in the county. For housing condition, only 2.8 \npercent of properties in Philadelphia had a reported housing quality or condition   of poor or unsound. The University of \nPennsylvania concluded that it is difficult to estimate the housing quality in Philadelphia using the American Housing Survey. \nThey used the City of Philadelphia’s Basic Systems Repair program to conclude that the low end of the range of properties in poor \ncondition is anywhere from 11,000 to over 40,000 properties.87 The City of Philadelphia estimates there are 40,000 vacant \nproperties, of which 74 percent are privately owned.88 Vacant properties were not included in the HAC’s estimation model. The \nvariation in results between the Pew research study may be attributed to assessment processes and data reporting.  Pew research \ndid not use property characteristics to identify properties. As discussed previously in the report, HAC’s estimates were very \nsensitive to housing quality and condition. For the county of Philadelphia, the housing quality and condition filter removed 97.3 \npercent of properties. However, the reported data does not align with other information about the condition of the housing stock \nin Philadelphia.  \nDobbs and Johnson Gaither (2023) used data from LightBox to estimate the prevalence of heirs’ property across the country89. By \nusing indicators in the owners’ name, researchers identified 444,172 heirs’ parcels, in comparison to HAC’s estimate of 580,3711 \nheirs’ properties. Dobbs and Johnson Gaither estimated parcels and used LightBox data from November 2021. HAC estimated \nproperties and used ICE data from November 2022. While some of the terms used in the methodology were similar, Dobbs and \nJohnson Gaither used some identifiers that HAC did not. HAC also used property characteristics to identify heirs’ property, which \ndiffers from Dobbs and Johnson Gaither’s methodology.90 \nTable 11.

Dobbs and Johnson Gaither identified 471 heirs’ \nparcels in Philadelphia and 4,801 heirs’ parcels in the state of Pennsylvania. Dobbs and Johnson Gaither argue that notation on \nthe county level may not consistently be transferred when procured by large national data agencies. Additionally, LightBox data \nare primarily used for identifying forest parcels, not ownership of properties.91 Thomson, Bailey, Dobbs, and Johnson Gaither \ncompared their 2023 research methodologies and findings across the two studies.92 Researchers concluded that differences in \ndata sources and methodologies produce varied results. Using researchers' data and comparison results, HAC added their \nfindings for the associated states for comparison. The total for the eleven states varies from 237,540 to 496,994 across the \nresearch studies. For ten states, Thomson and Bailey’s estimates were the highest. For West Virginia, HAC had the highest \nestimate. The estimates vary based by state due to the differences in methodology and the data sources.

While systemic racism undoubtedly shaped property \nrights and systems of land retention in the United States, low-income households of all races and ethnicities were and still are \nimpacted by systemic disinvestment and face challenges with heirs’ property. Research on predominantly White non-Hispanic \nregions, like Appalachia, presents the connection between systemically marginalized and low-income regions and the prevalence \nof heirs’ property.94  \nGiven the nature of the data set, presenting properties as recorded in the assessment in November 2022, Black-owned land that \nwas lost due to systemic violence, intimidation, title issues, predation by developers, and other means would not be represented \nin this data set.95 Portions of the methodology used in this research identify properties that were built and did not have a recent \nsale within the last 30 years. Research reports between 1969 and 2001, an estimated 80 percent of Black-owned land was lost.96   \nSome Black communities once comprised of Black landowners are now owned by municipalities and private businesses. For \nexample, Seneca Village in New York, taken via eminent domain, is now Central Park, owned by New York City.97 Many Black \nlandowners who owned hundreds of acres of land were forced out of Forsyth County, Georgia, due to racial violence. The \nproperty was declared legally abandoned, and White residents took over the land.98 The displacement of Black residents due to \nviolence was not unique to Forsyth County, as evident by the Great Migration.99 Today, Black landowners are still being pressured \nto relocate from land that has been in their families for generations. For example, the continued development of Hilton Head, \nMyrtle Beach, and other coastal resorts in South Carolina were built on formerly Gullah/Geechee land. Today, landowners in the \nGullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor and other coastal regions of South Carolina still face pressure and the threat of land \ntheft due to the expansion of the coastal resorts.100, 101, 102 \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 39 of 50 \nLand that has been lost due to systemic racism and title issues would not be captured in this data set. The analysis of race and \nethnicity in counties with a high prevalence of heirs’ property in this research was impacted by using current data that represents \nproperty ownership as of November 2022, and conducting an analysis using county-level demographics due to not having access \nto individual owners’ race and ethnicity data. An analysis of the relationship between heirs’ property, race, and land loss would \nalso provide additional insights regarding the relationship between heirs’ property and race. Additionally, research that analyzes \nindividual identified heirs’ property owners’ race and ethnicity would provide a more detailed perspective on the relationship \nbetween heirs’ property and race and ethnicity.  \nSome Properties with Indicators of a Transfer of Ownership upon an Owner’s Death also have Property Characteristics \nAligned with a Lack of Clear Title \nResearchers used methodologies to estimate two classifications of heirs’ property. First, researchers conducted an analysis to \ndetermine how many properties had indications of a transfer of ownership upon the owner’s death without probate. This \nclassification was meant to capture properties that are in municipalities that use this assessment procedure. Given the dynamic \nnature of the creation of heirs’ property, this category was also used to identify properties that may have been sold recently, have \ntax exemptions and mortgages, and are in average to good condition, yet have tangled titles and classify as an heirs’ property. \nPrior qualitative research demonstrates that the use of this nomenclature in the owners’ name is not standardized. To mitigate \nthis issue, HAC implemented a second methodology to capture properties that would not be captured in the most likely \nmethodology. The at risk methodology was used to capture properties that fit the characteristics of a property with title issues. \nThe two classifications were intended to capture properties with different characteristics and in municipalities with varied \nassessment practices. However, of the 88,834 properties with an indication of a transfer of ownership upon the owner’s death \nwithout probate, 4,760 also had property characteristics aligned with a lack of clear title. Further localized research in \nmunicipalities that use both assessment practices would aid in providing insights into the properties that have all characteristics.  \nFurther Validation is Needed Using Ground Truthing Methodology \nHAC engaged in a thorough analysis and triangulation of the data to produce the relative prevalence of heirs’ property across the \ncountry. Given the variation in data collection and availability, further validation of the findings by locality is needed. Unique \nnuances in data recordation and characteristics of properties without a title may present differently depending on the \nmunicipality. Data validation may be conducted using ground truthing methods. Ground truthing is the process of confirming the \naccuracy of data analysis with ground level, local data.103 Ground truthing and local validation can improve the research by \nverifying data to address discrepancies, and increasing confidence in the results.104  If the municipality has data regarding \nproperties confirmed to be in heirship status, using logistic regression to analyze the predictive strength of owner and property \ncharacteristics would further refine the estimation process. \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 40 of 50 \nPractitioner Recommendations and Strategies \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 41 of 50 \nPractitioner Recommendations and Strategies \nMitigation for the issue of heirs’ property takes collaborative and multifaceted approaches to assist residents without clear titles \nand prevent future properties from resulting in clouded titles. The resolutions include increased data availability, research, \neducation, policy changes, direct support, legal aid, and financial support. This section presents a sample of best practices, \nscalable solutions, and technical assistance for addressing heirs’ property issues.  \nHAC Conducted Qualitative Research in Partnership with Practitioners  \nHAC conducted qualitative research to highlight best practices and lessons learned from four organizations engaged in \naddressing the issue of heirs’ property. The four organizations were Auburn University’s Rural Studio, the Federation of Southern \nCooperatives, the Florida Housing Coalition, and the Louisiana Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. These organizations \nengaged in interviews and shared research publications regarding their approaches to addressing the issue of heirs’ property and \nsuggestions for scalable solutions.   \nUniform and Accessible Data are Needed to Accurately Scope the Issue of Heirs’ Properties \nResearch aiming to scale the prevalence of heirs’ property to date has been conservative due to data availability. The variability in \ndata collection and reporting processes does not allow for a true scope of the prevalence of heirs’ properties across the country. \nIn some localities, like Louisiana, decentralized recordation systems make accessing data challenging. 105 Proactively identifying \nheirs’ properties serves as a mitigation strategy and will be strengthened by partnerships between federal, state, and local \nentities. Capacity, funding, and access to parcel-level tax roll data will support efforts to identify, map, and track heirs’ properties \nacross the country.106, 107  \nUniformity in property data would not only enhance heirs’ property research but also highlight other housing condition issues in \nthe nation. Regardless of the data source, every study on heirs’ property reports missing data inhibits the ability to truly scope the \nprevalence of heirs’ property. Support is needed to continue to efforts of retrieving county-level records and connecting with \nproperty owners to identify heirs’ properties across the country.108   \nHomeowners Need Access to Necessary Financial Products that are Inclusive of All Forms of Homeownership.  \nHeirs’ property residents and owners deserve access to wealth acquisition and land retention opportunities, comparable to other \nhome and property owners. There are benefits associated with intentional familial land control structures, including defense \nagainst homelessness and opportunities for strengthened kinship. There are also vulnerabilities associated with tenancy in \ncommon ownership, and barriers to accessing financial and federal systems.  \nIncluding heirs’ property owners in housing funding programs and policies, such as subsidized housing programs, would alleviate \nsome of the barriers faced by residents. Policy changes regarding proof of ownership for housing assistance programs and the \ncreation of policies specifically for assisting and addressing heirs’ properties are also essential. Heirs’ property owners also need \naccess to insurance, post-disaster recovery options, and tax exemptions.109 FEMA director Deanna Criswell testified during a \ncongressional hearing in June 2022 that FEMA’s policy change to accept alternate forms of documentation to prove land control \nresulted in the approval of $350 million in assistance to homeowners and renters that would previously have been denied.110 It is \nevident that the inclusion of broader form of homeownership has major impacts for homeowners and communities.  \nFinancial institutions could help mitigate the issue of heirs’ properties by providing funding options for heirs’ property owners. \nThe Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act’s five pillars aim to mitigate the threat of land loss to heirs’ property owners. The \nUPHPA has been adopted in 23 states. The act aims to provide increased protection, rights, and advance notice of heirs in the \nevent of a partial sale.111 The UPHPA includes a right to buy-out for heirs’ owners who desire to retain the property.112 However, for \nlow-income families, the financial capital needed for buy-out is often unattainable. Financial institutions could create a financial \nproduct which supports heirs’ property owners who desire to purchase the entirety of the property from other partial owners.  \nFinancial products and support for heirs’ property owners, which works within their chosen familial land control is also needed. \nRural Studio does an example of this work.113 Using a philanthropic model, residents in need of assistance are not evaluated using \neligibility criteria, including proof of ownership. Rural Studio works within familial land control agreements and community land \ncontrol agreements. Families may use their property as family settlements, with multiple housing units on the property, or may \ndivide the property based on mutually agreed upon landmarks.114 Through training and technical assistance, financial entities, \nlocal nonprofits, and intermediaries can learn tools to implement a similar financial model to support heirs’ property owners.115 \n \n \n \n \n \n© 2023 Fannie Mae    3.29.24     Page 42 of 50 \nMediation Services, Legal Aid, and Education Resolve and Prevent Title Issues \nAttorneys and other practitioners call for increased access to mediation, legal aid, and education for households. Preventing the \ncreation of future heirs’ properties through legal assistance and education can reduce the impact of title issues for residents. \nEducation can be provided at stages throughout the home purchasing process, including through real estate closings, \nhomeowner counseling, homeowner assistance programs, and community programs.116 Mortgage lenders could provide \neducation to new homeowners regarding the importance of estate planning and steps to ensure their property does not become \nheirs’ property.117 County property appraisers, housing counselors, and real estate agents also must be educated on the \nimportance of clear title and estate planning to educate clients and homeowners.118  \nThe expansion of legal aid services to provide homeowners with the opportunity to complete estate planning would also reduce \nthe prevalence of future heirs’ properties by removing cost barriers. Direct aid like the Federation of Southern Cooperatives’ heirs’ \nbootcamp, which provides free aid directly to impacted owners free of cost, helps heirs’ property owners clear their title.119 \nScaling the model would require increased funding for direct assistance and partnerships with law schools for training \nopportunities and fellowships. The Federation created a certified mediation program in partnership with the universities to allow \nmore Black lawyers access to mediation training. The heirs’ bootcamp, partnerships with universities, and certified mediation \ntraining programs are scalable with the support of additional funding. Because clearing titles is a legal process, access to legal aid \nfor heirs’ property owners is essential to addressing the issue.120  \nWhile legal aid is essential, finances are also a barrier which prevents some heirs’ property owners from completing the process of \nclearing title. The courts have a process available for low-income petitioners to file a lawsuit or appeal and proceed to court \nwithout having to pay the court fees. 121, 122 IFP, in forma pauperis, allows petitioners who are unable to afford court fees to file a \nlawsuit or appeal and if the petitioner wins, the opposing party is responsible for the costs.123 IFP is not extended to petitioners in \nneed of title resolution, however, given there is no adverse party. Creating a process which allows low-income heirs’ property \nowners to proceed through the legal process, with an option for financial support, would remove one cost barrier in the process \nof clearing a title.124  \nThere are additional cost barriers including the cost for mediation, recordation costs, fees, and overall costs of legal aid. Financial \nsupport for the costs associated with clearing a title, in addition to the expansion of civil legal aid and opportunities to mitigate \ncosts through resolving family issues outside of courts, will remove some of the barriers heirs’ property owners face in the process \nof clearing a title.125  \nMediation strategies, financial support, and opportunities for scalable solutions must be accompanied by continued advocacy for \nchanges in policy. Continued advocacy for changes in accepted documentation for proof of land control is essential to addressing \nthe issue of heirs’ property. Additionally, state policymakers must be informed about the issues of heirs’ properties and mitigation \nstrategies which can be implemented in their states.126  \nPartnership and Collaboration are Needed to Address the Issues Associated with Heirs’ Property  \nPartnership and collaboration are central to resolving the systemic issues that affect heirs’ property owners. Intermediaries for \nfederal programs could serve as the connection between federal programs and funding, and local nonprofits can connect with \nresidents and implement solutions for heirs’ properties at the household level. Local nonprofits can partner with local community \nservice workers and daily delivery personnel who are aware of what is occurring in multiple households. The input of the \ncommunity members can be used for referral services and education for the community.127  \nThe partnership model between the federal government, intermediaries, and local nonprofits through specific programs for \nassisting heirs’ property owners should include technical assistance for the nonprofits to learn about the issue of heirs’ property \nand mitigation strategies.128 Organizations could engage in a technical assistance model to offer on-the-ground training to \nhousing providers. Local nonprofits could learn about which housing products can be offered to heirs’ property owners and \ncreate successful partnerships with organizations that provide wraparound services.129  \nHeirs’ property has been created through generations of systemic racism and exclusion. The approaches to addressing the issues \nvary across fields, states, and even individual households. Partnership, advocacy, education, and financial support will support \nthe efforts to prevent and mitigate issues associated with heirs’ properties. Financial support, policy change, legal aid, and \ncollaboration can mitigate the vulnerabilities associated with tenancy in common ownership, and the barriers in accessing \nfinancial and federal systems. Through continued research, community education, education of state policy makers, housing \npractitioners, and professionals in the housing and finance fields, future heirs’ properties can be prevented. The solutions to \naddress the issue of heirs’ property will require an investment of time, resources, and funding from financial, federal, state, and \nlocal entities.

LeBlanc is enjoying his new space and the excitement of his investment. He’s also talking to others about taking steps toward homeownership.\n“I like knowing beyond a doubt that I own my space, and no one else can tell me what I can and can’t do with it,” LeBlanc shared. “I’ve encouraged all of my peers around me, if you have the opportunity and the ability, and you’re looking for it, definitely go out and buy your own house.”"

You may need to consult an attorney familiar with real estate records.Please remember that discriminatory restrictive covenants based on race, religion, national origin or sex are illegal and unenforceable.There is no obligation to remove the discriminatory restrictive covenant in order for all homeowners to enjoy the ownership and use of their properties regardless of their race, religion, national origin, or sex."

DUS® is a unique system \nof collaboration. We authorize our lenders to underwrite, \nclose, and deliver most loans without our pre-review, and \nin exchange they share the risk of loss on those loans. In \nturn, this offers the borrower certainty of execution, faster \ndecisions, quicker closings, and better pricing. It is a complete \npartnership: We share the risk, and we share the reward. It’s \nalso why we describe it as “the loan we all own” – because it \naligns and empowers each of us, every step of the way. \nWe support America’s favorite mortgage.\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the favorite among homebuyers – and \nFannie Mae helps make it possible. With fixed, predictable, low monthly \npayments and the option to prepay, this uniquely American product offers \naffordability, stability, and reliability. It puts the dream of homeownership \nwithin reach for generations of homebuyers, just as it has since our \nfounding during the Great Depression. As a leading source of liquidity, we \nensure lenders can continue to offer this preferred mortgage.\nThe mortgage of choice\nIn 2017, 76% of Americans seeking a conventional, \nfirst-lien mortgage chose the 30-year fixed-rate \nmortgage.

By introducing  \nDay 1 Certainty™, we’re bringing greater speed and clarity to \nlenders and borrowers–and setting a new standard for lending \nin America. We have given lenders tools to validate key data about \nborrower income and assets, as well as home value.\nDay 1 Certainty enables lenders to streamline the way they create \nmortgages. It empowers our customers to grow their business \nand meet market demands.

Behind the enduring concept, however, lies a \nsophisticated housing finance ecosystem that is constantly evolving. This \necosystem consists of a remarkably diverse network of people, professions, \ncompanies, and government bodies who all help make affordable homeownership \nand rental housing options possible for millions of American families.\nFannie Mae plays a leading role in this ecosystem. In simplest terms, we serve \nthe people who house America. We provide reliable, affordable mortgage \nfinancing in all markets at all times, buying loans that banks and other lenders \noriginate so they can fund new loans. This gives more people the opportunity to \nbuy, refinance, or rent homes. Creating these opportunities with our partners is \nwhat drives the people who work at Fannie Mae.\nIn 2015, Fannie Mae and housing finance continued to evolve at a rapid pace. \nWhile Fannie Mae remains in conservatorship, we are a vastly different and \nstronger company than we were just a few years ago. Our work with mortgage \nlenders and other housing partners is driving exciting changes in how America \nfinances mortgages, how we create housing opportunities, and how we meet \ntoday’s most critical housing challenges.\n2\nWe work with our partners to drive transformative changes \nthat expand opportunities for our customers, homeowners, \nand renters. \nOver the course of the past 25 years, technology has transformed almost \nevery industry; some more than once. Until recently, however, applying for a \nmortgage, closing on a mortgage, and making the monthly mortgage payment \nlooked and felt much like it did in the 1990s. \nThat is rapidly changing as technology dramatically raises the bar on what \nconsumers expect from the mortgage experience. Our job is to help our lender \ncustomers meet those expectations by providing innovative, easy-to-use \ntools, and great service. In fact, the changes we are making not only help our \ncustomers succeed, they also make mortgage lending safer by providing more \ncomplete and accurate information about the key factors in underwriting a loan \n– from the value of the home being purchased to the borrower’s income and \ncredit history. \nIn 2015, for example, we expanded our use of tools that make it easier and \nmore efficient for lenders to underwrite a loan, appraise the value of a house, \ndeliver a loan to Fannie Mae, and service a loan after it closes. We drove \nbroader adoption of automated resources that help lenders find solutions for \nhomeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments. We also introduced \na new technology platform that makes it easier for our multifamily lenders to \ndo business with us.\nIn addition, we began offering new tools and simplified our policies so \nthat we and our customers can better know the quality of a loan before it \nis even funded, let alone delivered to us. This allows lenders to lend with \nmore confidence because it gives them more certainty that a loan meets our \nstandards and reduces repurchase risk, a major pain point for lenders in the \nwake of the housing crisis.\nIn 2016, we will introduce new automated solutions that provide lenders with \na more complete picture of a homeowner’s financial situation over time and \nvalidate income and asset data for people applying for a mortgage, reducing \npaperwork for everyone.\nTaken together, these tools can help lenders do business more efficiently, \nreduce mortgage fraud, and put homeowners in loans that are affordable and \nsustainable over the long term.\nA Message from Our CEO\n3\nWe are also changing our business culture by putting the customer at the center \nof everything we do. This includes changing the way we are organized, so that \nour customers can do business with us more easily and get the answers they \nneed quickly.\nFannie Mae was created to serve our customers and other stakeholders, and \nwe succeed by helping them succeed. This central truth drives every business \ndecision we make. It is why we listen closely to our customers in the hundreds \nof conversations we have with them every day. It is why we are committed to \nproviding them with products and services that are not simply good, but great. \nIt is why we are doing all we can to make doing business with us easier, more \ncertain, and less expensive. By helping customers grow their business, we help \nmore Americans obtain reliable, sustainable, low-cost mortgage financing.\nWe are fulfilling our core mission to provide affordable \nmortgage financing in all markets at all times.\nTimes change but our housing mission endures. We are in the market every day, \nusing our knowledge, experience, and scale to help lenders across the country \nlend with confidence to creditworthy borrowers and finance the construction of \nworkforce rental housing.\nDuring the housing crisis, private capital retreated from the mortgage market. \nFannie Mae, with the support of taxpayers, did not. \nhome purchases\n6M\nrefinancings\n14M\nrental units\n3M\n$5T to the market since 2009 has enabled:\n4\nA Message from Our CEO\n5\nSince the start of 2009, we have financed approximately 6 million home \npurchases, 14 million refinancings, and 3 million rental apartments. These \nnumbers are so large that they can be difficult to truly appreciate, so let me \noffer this for perspective: As you drive through your neighborhood, or any \ntypical neighborhood in any part of the country, about one out of every three \nsingle-family homes you see was likely purchased or refinanced with Fannie \nMae financing.\nWe also are a leader in helping homeowners and communities that were hit \nhardest by the housing crisis. We introduced innovative loan modifications \nand other products that were adopted broadly by the industry. Since 2009, \nwe have helped families avoid foreclosure through approximately 1.8 million \nloan modifications and other loan workouts, and we’ve helped homeowners \nsave money on their mortgage each month through approximately 4.4 million \nrefinancings, delivered through our streamlined Refi PlusTM initiative. \nToday, as housing continues to recover, Fannie Mae is also looking ahead \nto future challenges that are coming into focus. Our research shows that an \naverage of 1.2 million new households will form every year in the second half \nof this decade, far above the 900,000 per year we experienced in the first half \nof the decade. This means that over the next five years, we believe housing \ndemand will grow sharply, with 6 million new American households needing \nhousing options they can afford, with the bulk of this growth coming from \nminority communities and millennials.\nWe have a responsibility to help lenders provide families with safe, sustainable \nmortgage and rental housing options. We especially want to ensure that \nfamilies have access to the 15- and 30-year fixed-rate loans that we help make \npossible. At the end of 2015, these mortgages made up 84 percent of our single-\nfamily loans, and they remain the mortgage of choice for the vast majority of \nAmerican homebuyers because they provide certainty, predictability, and the \nability to refinance at any time.\nSince 2009, Fannie Mae has helped  \nprevent 1.8M foreclosures and delivered  \n4.4M Refi Plus refinancings\n6\nIn 2015, to help meet future demand, we introduced an affordable, sustainable \nmortgage called HomeReady®. HomeReady provides lenders with more \nflexibility in serving creditworthy, low- to moderate-income borrowers, \nespecially in low-income areas, areas with high minority populations, and \nareas hurt by disasters. HomeReady also breaks new ground by providing \nflexibility on the source of the down payment and by allowing borrowers to \ncount income from other household members. This can be a big boost for many \nextended families, minority families, and non-traditional families. Importantly, \na HomeReady mortgage is also safe and sustainable, backed by solid analytics \nand underwriting.\nHomeReady is just one example of the kind of innovations that are possible \nwhen we bring our know-how, our data, and our nationwide reach to bear on \ntough housing challenges. It is a microcosm of our larger responsibility to \nensure that America’s next generation of mortgage products is tailored to the \ncircumstances of the next generation of Americans. It is also a symbol of our \nunwavering commitment to help our customers serve all segments of today’s \nmortgage market confidently and efficiently.  \nWe have fundamentally changed the way we do business in \nways that make Fannie Mae and housing finance stronger.\nOver the past seven years, Fannie Mae has not only made changes to our  \nbusiness, we have changed our business model. These changes involve the \ntypes of loans that we finance as well as what we do with the loans once they \ncome through our door. Together, these changes make the company stronger, \nprovide more protection to taxpayers, and expand the role of private capital in \nthe housing finance system.\nBeginning in 2008, Fannie Mae took action to significantly strengthen our \nunderwriting and eligibility standards to improve the quality of loans delivered \nto us. \nOur strength, however, comes not just from a stronger book of business but \na stronger business model – one that is more sustainable, and more reliable. \nTen years ago, the primary driver of our revenue was our retained investment \nportfolio, securities and other assets we purchased with our low cost of funds. \nAt its peak, we held about $900 billion of investment assets in our portfolio. \nA Message from Our CEO\n7\nToday, we have reduced our investment portfolio to less than $200 billion, with \nmore reductions on the way. The main driver of our revenues is no longer the \nportfolio but the more stable and predictable flow of guaranty fees we earn on \nmortgages we have guaranteed and pooled into mortgage-backed securities.\nAlongside this evolution, we are moving from being a company that stores \ncredit risk to one that also intelligently distributes credit risk to other market \nparticipants. This means greater protection and less risk for taxpayers. \nIn the past, when we bought or securitized a mortgage for a single-family \nhome, we acquired all the credit risk that went with the mortgage and typically \nheld it through the life of the asset. Today, we are moving a significant portion \nof the credit risk on newly acquired loans away from us (and taxpayers) to \nprivate capital. We do this through innovative capital market transactions \nand reinsurance transactions. Investors are attracted to these transactions \nbecause they understand that we have developed world-class capabilities to \nassess credit risk, manage loan servicers, and minimize losses when loans \ngo delinquent. By the end of 2015, we had transferred a significant portion of \nthe credit risk on more than half a trillion dollars of loans, helping to increase \nprivate investment in mortgage credit.\nIn our multifamily business, we continue to share the risk on more than 90 \npercent of our transactions with our lenders. We continue to expand and \nenhance this model so that we can serve the widest possible spectrum of the \nmultifamily market.\nThe changes we and our partners are making to the housing finance ecosystem \nare real and they are accelerating. Few are given the chance to help an industry \nfundamentally reinvent itself to meet future challenges. The people who work \nat Fannie Mae are honored to play a role in leading changes to our housing \nfinance system. \nTimothy J. Mayopoulos\n8\nLeadership & \nInnovation\n9\nLeadership & Innovation\nWe serve the people who house America.\nAt Fannie Mae, we’re a do-it-together team. \nWorking with our customers and partners, we’re moving housing in the United \nStates forward. Today’s housing finance system is stronger, safer, and more \nefficient than it was in the past. It is a system that helps to ensure reliable, \naffordable homes are available across the nation, at all times. A system that \nprotects – not leverages – taxpayers. This is America’s new housing system. \nFannie Mae is proud to support it.\n10\n11\nIn Michigan, the recession led to \ncrushing job losses in the auto \nindustry, forcing many families \nfrom their homes. In 2015, we \nprovided the financing for 68,000 \nsingle-family loans, helping families \nto plant new, sustainable roots.\nIn Michigan\nIn Florida\nFlorida was hit hardest during the \nhousing crisis when home values \nplummeted. We’re helping to \nstabilize the local housing market. \nIn 2015, we enabled more than \n125,000 home purchases and \nrefinancings.\n60K\n30K\n10K\nLoans \nin 2015:\nIn California\nCalifornia is home to the nation’s \ntoughest housing affordability \nissues — only 30% of households \ncan afford to buy a median-priced \nhome. In 2015, Fannie Mae enabled \nfamilies to buy or refinance \nmore than 350,000 homes in the \ncountry’s most populous state.\nLeadership & Innovation\nFor nearly 80 years, we’ve been a leading source of financing for America’s \nhousing. We have funded more home mortgages than any other company. We \nhave financed millions of units of workforce rental housing. We have attracted \nglobal capital to meet the changing demands of the market. \nWe have done all this even during tough economic times, when others left the \nmarket. In good times and bad, we have the commitment, deep experience, and \nknow-how to keep the market healthy and to help ensure responsible lending \nfor qualified borrowers across the country. \nWe bring the finance to the U.S. housing \nfinance system. \nWe give people across the U.S. the opportunity \nto buy, refinance, and rent homes.\n13\nWe’re serving the spectrum of the \nnation’s rental housing needs.\nIn 2015, we announced that we will provide the \nfinancing for one of the country’s most significant \nresidential communities, Stuyvesant Town-Peter \nCooper Village in New York City. The deal will \nensure rental housing is available – and affordable \n– for working and middle-class families in this \nlarge community over the next 20 years.\n“Preserving rental housing for moderate-\nincome residents in New York City is a \nsignificant challenge. Fannie Mae is the \nleader in providing financing for workforce \nhousing. Our deep understanding of \nthe multifamily market combined with \nour financing expertise will ensure the \npreservation of this much needed workforce \nhousing in one of the most expensive \nmarkets in the country.” \n– Jeffery Hayward, \n Executive Vice President for Multifamily\nFor nearly 30 years, providing financing to \nthe rental market through our DUS® lender \npartnerships has been the core mission of \nFannie Mae’s Multifamily business. Our unique \nDUS platform relies on shared risk, with lenders \nretaining some of the underlying credit risk of the \nloans they deliver to Fannie Mae. DUS lenders can \nunderwrite, close, deliver, and service loans on all \ntypes of multifamily properties. This means faster \ndecisions and quicker closings for customers.\nStuyvesant Town-Peter \nCooper Village\n•\t Historic residential community on \nManhattan’s East Side\n•\t 110 buildings\n•\t 11,241 units (5,000 are affordable to \nmoderate-income residents)\n•\t $2.7 billion loan\n•\t Working in partnership with \nBlackstone and Wells Fargo \nMultifamily Capital, one of our 25 \nDelegated Underwriting and Servicing \n(DUS®) lenders\nPhoto: Mr. Taylor Crothers\nLeadership & Innovation\n14\nLeadership & Innovation\nWe’ve been doing this for a long time. \nShared systems. Shared success.\nOur customers need tools that streamline their processes \nand help them manage risk. In 2015, we revolutionized the \nappraisal process by making Collateral Underwriter™, our \nextensive proprietary appraisal risk assessment platform, \nfully available to Fannie Mae lenders. With Collateral \nUnderwriter, lenders can address appraisal quality issues \nbefore delivering loans to Fannie Mae – at no cost. \nBut we didn’t stop there. We integrated Collateral \nUnderwriter with our industry-preferred loan underwriting \nsystem, Desktop Underwriter®, to give lenders even more \nrisk management capabilities. And, we eliminated the fees \nto use both Desktop Underwriter and Desktop Originator®. \nNow lenders can deliver strong mortgages, faster, with \ngreater certainty.\nOur scale, experience, and expertise give us a unique perspective in the housing \nmarket, and we put it to work every day. From creating the gold standard in \nmortgage-backed securities to pioneering the industry-preferred automated \nunderwriting system. From building the largest loss mitigation platform to \nrolling out responsible, innovative mortgage products. We deliver smart \nsolutions for customers, homeowners, and renters.\nThis is our legacy. This is our future.\n15\nFannie Mae has the market intelligence \nneeded for better mortgage lending from \ncoast to coast. We want to share it with you.\nWe’re always thinking about homebuyers and renters. After all, together with \nour lenders and servicers, we’re homebuyers and renters, too. With stronger \nmarket intelligence, our partners can better serve their customers. That means \nputting more people into homes they can afford for the long term. \nIt’s why we base everything we do on in-depth market data, research, and \nanalysis – and it’s why we share that information at no charge. We’re helping \nmortgage lenders, real estate agents, and other industry pros to understand \nwhat’s happening in the housing market now and what it could mean for their \nbusiness in the future. \nFrom mortgage expertise, to diverse \nresources, to actionable data. It’s all here.\nOur industry thrives on data to make decisions. In 2015, we introduced easy, \nself-serve access to the information our partners need to do better business. \nFannie Mae’s new Home Purchase Sentiment Index™ is a measure of \nconsumers’ attitudes on the home purchase environment. It distills data from \nour National Housing Survey® – a monthly poll of 1,000 homeowners and \nrenters on their housing and financial outlook – into a single indicator. The \n“HPSI” is unique. Unlike general economic indices, it’s devoted entirely to \nhousing, designed to provide distinct signals on future housing outcomes. \nWe also created a pipeline of new data to our customers, helping them get \ninformation quickly and in a well-designed format that allows them to dig for \nmore insight. With Fannie Mae ConnectTM, lenders have real-time access to \ndata, reports, and analytics that are tailored to their individual business.\n16\nLeadership & Innovation\nAmerica is changing, and we’re  \nchanging with it.\nThe nation’s housing demographics are constantly shifting. \nTo serve the market effectively, you need to anticipate and \nmeet the needs of its homebuyers. \nWe’re focused on introducing better tools to the mortgage market based on \nneeds, insights, and data. Our solutions are tailored to help lenders bring the \nmortgage experience into the 21st century and make the mortgage-buying \nprocess easier to navigate. However, the most important goal is not getting \npeople into homes – it’s keeping them there. \nAt Fannie Mae, we are expanding access to mortgage credit in a responsible \nway. We design our products to help qualified borrowers find housing \nopportunities that are affordable and sustainable for the long term. \n17\nService & Certainty\n19\nService & Certainty\nThis is what we do. This is how we work. This is what we \nbring to the nation’s housing providers. We’re committed \nto being America’s most valued housing partner.\nWe’ve improved our end-to-end products, services, and capabilities to optimize \nthe everyday customer experience. The result? Our lenders, servicers, and other \nindustry partners can work with the ease, efficiency, and transparency they \nneed to succeed.\nSimplicity. Certainty. Service. Results.\n20\nService & Certainty\nThe status quo is not for us.\nAt Fannie Mae, we know building a better housing system \nstarts at our front door. \nWe’re continually improving our company, streamlining the way we work, \nand anticipating tomorrow’s challenges. We are driving important changes in \nhousing finance.\nIt’s about building for the future. We are a vastly improved company now than \nwe were a few years ago. We have fundamentally changed the way we do \nbusiness, in ways that make both Fannie Mae and America’s housing safer and \nbetter, while reducing risk for taxpayers. Today, the majority of our revenue \ncomes from our guaranty business rather than from our retained investment \nportfolio. This source of revenue is more stable, reliable, and predictable.\nCredit Risk Transfer — What is it?\nOld Model\nLender\nMBS\nFannie \nMae\nRisk remained  \nwith Fannie Mae\nFannie Mae:\n•\t Guaranteed timely payment \nof principal and interest to \nMBS investor\n•\t Kept all credit risk associated \nwith loan acquisitions\n•\t Managed credit risk through \nunderwriting and eligibility \nguidelines, lender oversight, \nquality control practices, \nservicing policies, and credit \nportfolio management\n21\nWe’ve strengthened our business, and we’ve strengthened \nour core business model. \nIn recent years, we have moved away from being a company that only acquires \nand holds mortgage credit risk. Instead, we distribute much of that risk through \nour credit risk transfer transactions – facilitating the flow of private capital \nbetween Fannie Mae’s 1,200 lenders and a diverse group of investors. This \nallows financial institutions to invest in the credit performance of our single-\nfamily book of business. \nCredit risk sharing isn’t new at Fannie Mae, but it has evolved dramatically \nsince the financial crisis. In just over two years, we have created a new market \nfor credit risk transfers, bolstered by our innovative, industry-leading credit risk \nmanagement resources.\nWhy? Because moving risk away from Fannie Mae means moving risk away \nfrom taxpayers, reducing the role of government, and expanding the role of \nprivate capital in America’s mortgage market. \nFannie Mae is creating new markets for credit \nrisk transfers.\nNew Model\nLender\nMBS\nCredit \nInvestor\nFannie \nMae\nPortion of risk is transferred to \ncredit investors\nFannie Mae:\n•\t Guarantees timely payment  \nof principal and interest to  \nMBS investor\n•\t Sells a portion of credit risk  \nto investors\n•\t Applies its credit risk \nmanagement expertise on \nbehalf of investors to protect \nthe value of their investment\n22\nOur technology is transforming the  \nhousing market.\nOur goal is to enable all our lender customers to work \nbetter and achieve more. When they succeed, homeowners \nand renters get the benefits. \nAt Fannie Mae, we’re melding our deep knowledge of mortgage finance with \nworld-class technology capabilities. No matter our customers’ focus – from loan \norigination to delivery and servicing – our tools are helping to modernize and \nsimplify the mortgage process. We are streamlining the customer workflow and \nmaking it easier to do business with greater certainty.\nService & Certainty\n23\nGoodbye, old systems and processes.  \nHello, DUS Gateway\nTM.\nIn 2015, we debuted our new front-end loan approval system for our \nmultifamily lenders. DUS Gateway transforms the way we manage our loan \npipeline and helps our lenders serve the widest possible spectrum of the \nrental market. Using one common platform, lenders can collaborate directly \nwith their Fannie Mae partners, sharing data and documents quickly for \nbetter results. With DUS Gateway, deals get done smarter and faster.\n24\nOpportunity & \nResponsibility\n85%\nSingle-family loans \nacquired since  \nJanuary 1, 2009\nExcluding HARP® \nand other Refi \nPlus loans\nHARP loans\nOther Refi Plus \nloans\n67%\n10%\n8%\n15%\nSingle-family loans \nacquired prior to 2009\nComposition of our single-family book of business:\n25\nOpportunity & Responsibility\nFannie Mae plays an essential role in setting loan eligibility, underwriting, and \nrisk management standards for the housing industry. These go hand in hand \nwith our commitment to bring housing opportunities to creditworthy families \nacross the country. At the same time, we help ensure that people only take out \nmortgages they can afford and maintain for the life of the loan.\nBeginning in 2008, we took action to strengthen our underwriting and eligibility \nstandards to improve loan quality. Since then, we have seen the effect of \nthose actions reflected in a stronger single-family book of business – one that \npromotes sustainable homeownership and stability in the housing market.\nWe’re expanding access to mortgage credit. \nBut never at the expense of our company  \nor the market.\n26\nOpportunity & Responsibility\nWe’re leading the way to help our lender customers make \nthese three things a reality.\nPeople need mortgages they can afford for the long term. That’s why we’re a \nleading source of liquidity for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage – Americans’ \npreferred mortgage product. \nWith long-term, fixed-rate mortgages, homeowners have predictable monthly \npayments and protection from interest rate swings. They can also refinance at \nany time, enabling them to save money over the life of the loan. \nWhen it comes to financing a home,  \nmost borrowers look for three things:  \nsafety, affordability, and reliability. \n17.3M\nsingle-family\nconventional loans\nas of 12/31/15\n97%\nare current \non payments\n88%\nare primary \nresidences\n84%\nare 15- and \n30-year \nfixed-rate \nmortgages\n27\n28\nWe provide the resources and options the industry needs to help struggling \nhomeowners. Our shared goal is to give them every opportunity available to \navoid foreclosure and get back on their feet. \nSince 2009, we’ve helped families through approximately \n6.2 million loan modifications, loan workouts, and \nstreamlined refinancings.\nFor a family facing foreclosure, it can feel  \nlike they’ve reached a dead end. \nOpportunity & Responsibility\n200K\n600K\n1.2M\nRefi Plus refinancings\nLoan workouts\nLoan modifications\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nIn 2012, we removed the loan-to-value \ncap on Refi Plus to help more underwater \nborrowers benefit from low interest rates.\n29\nWe’re stepping up to meet the nation’s  \nmost pressing housing needs.\nThe people of Fannie Mae are at the heart of housing – and \nvolunteerism is at the heart of Fannie Mae. \nOur responsibility to serve the housing market goes beyond our day-to-day \nbusiness transactions. Through our SERVE employee volunteer program, we’re \nhelping to rebuild America’s hardest-hit communities, and helping people to \novercome financial and social barriers to safe, affordable housing.\nGiving back is central to who we are. That’s why our employees are free to \nchoose and coordinate their own volunteer projects for eligible non-profit \norganizations. Some plan and join in team efforts. Others participate in \nnational days of service, such as Martin Luther King Day and the 9/11 Day of \nRemembrance. \nAll our efforts have one powerful thing in common, rooted deeply in who we \nare.

These expectations are forward-looking statements based on our current assumptions \nregarding numerous factors. Our actual results and future expectations may differ materially from our current expectations as a result of  many \nfactors, including those discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of and elsewhere in our 2014 Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements are \nrepresentative only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new \ninformation, future events or otherwise, except as required under the federal securities laws.\n1\nGrowing up in Pennsylvania, my family and I lived \nin a modest three-bedroom semi-detached house \nin a suburban neighborhood, where all the little \nhouses looked nearly the same. I shared a bed-\nroom with my two brothers. I still remember that \nhome vividly, down to the last detail. \nWhether you own or rent, or are saving up to buy \nyour first home, or you work behind the scenes to \nbuild or invest in America’s housing, you should \nhave the ability to create your own memories – \nnow and for years to come. \nIt is our mission at Fannie Mae to ensure that fam-\nilies across the country have access to mortgage \ncredit to buy, refinance, or rent homes that are \naffordable for the long term. It is what motivates \nour work to help build a better housing finance \nsystem for the future. We take great pride in, and \nare inspired by, the promise of working together to \nbuild something strong and lasting. \nFor me personally, it is a privilege to lead an \norganization that is so committed to our important \nwork, and our progress is a continuing source \nof satisfaction. We have come a very long way. \nWe have improved our business, maintained \nresponsible lending standards, enhanced our \nrisk management capabilities, and created new \ntools that benefit lenders and the housing finance \nsystem. We continued to reduce delinquencies \nand achieve strong credit performance in 2014. \nWe have helped many families who are struggling \nwith their mortgages to keep their homes and avoid \nforeclosure. \nOur investments in our infrastructure are making \nit more efficient, to the benefit of our customers \nand the country. We are the largest source of \nfunding for single-family mortgages in the U.S., \nand we remain a leading source of financing and \nsecuritization for quality rental housing for people \nof all income levels throughout the nation. At the \nsame time, we also are taking steps to attract more \nprivate capital to the market, which reduces risk \nand minimizes taxpayer exposure.\nWe have provided solid value to America by \nimproving our financial performance since entering \ninto conservatorship, helping to stabilize the hous-\ning market in the wake of the financial crisis. While \nthey do not reduce the draws we have taken from \nTreasury, we have paid $134.5 billion in dividends \nto the taxpayers for the nation’s investment in us. \nThis is a testament to our employees’ hard work \nto improve the housing finance system, provide \nliquidity, and help the housing market recover. \nIt demonstrates our ability to deliver positive \noutcomes for the housing finance system and for \ntaxpayers. \nIn 2015, we will remain focused on providing our \npartners – large and small – with the best customer \nservice and competitive products so they can serve \nall segments of the market confidently, efficiently, \nand profitably. We will continue to push ahead on \nthe things we control and effectively respond to \nchanges we do not control. \nFannie Mae will lead housing finance forward. We \nare committed to being America’s most valued \nhousing partner. \n—Timothy J. Mayopoulos\nIn the Words of Our CEO\n3\nBuilding a Stronger Future\nFannie Mae’s business relies on intelligent risk management, and in 2014 we made strong \nprogress in enhancing our infrastructure to make the housing finance system safer and more \nefficient. We completed new risk-sharing initiatives to increase the role of private capital \nin the market, helping to protect taxpayers. We worked closely with our servicers to help \nthousands of distressed homeowners avoid foreclosure, and we continued to acquire loans \nwith strong overall credit profiles. We continued to put the legacy issues resulting from the \nfinancial crisis behind us, and re-committed ourselves to our customers as we contribute to \na stronger, more sustainable housing system. We focused on delivering excellent results \nand preparing the company to succeed in a new competitive market in the future. These \ncritical reforms are underway, they have reduced the risk to Fannie Mae’s business, and \nhelp us meet the strategic goals of our conservatorship.\nFor 2014, we reported $14.2 billion in net income and $14.7 billion in comprehensive \nincome. Our 2014 financial results enabled us to pay $20.6 billion in dividends to Treasury \nfor the year, resulting in a cumulative total of $134.5 billion in dividends through December \n31, 2014 – approximately $18 billion more than we have received in support. As of March \n31, 2015, we expect to have paid a total of $136.4 billion in dividend payments to Treasury. \nOur payments do not reduce our prior draws.\nOur progress goes far beyond our financial results. To help protect the foundation of \nAmerica’s housing finance system, beginning in 2008 we took actions to significantly \nstrengthen our underwriting and eligibility standards and change our pricing to promote \nsustainable homeownership and stability in the market. These actions have improved the \ncredit quality of our book of business and contributed to better credit performance. In turn, \nthis has helped to support families and stabilize neighborhoods, home prices, and the \nhousing market – all contributing to a stronger housing system in America, built to last for \ngenerations to come.\n$15.2\n2008\n$60.0\n2009\n$15.0\n2010\n$25.9\n2011\n$0.0\n2012\n$0.0\n2013\n$0.0\n2014\nDraw Request from Treasury\n(in billions)\nTBD\n1Q15\nCumulative\nTotal\nInitial Liquidation Preference\n$1.0 \nTreasury Draw Requests1 \n$116.1 \nTotal Senior Preferred Stock Outstanding\n$117.1 \n$2.5\n2009\n$7.7\n2010\n$9.6\n2011\n$11.6\n2012\nDividend Payment to Treasury\n(in billions)\n$20.6\n2014\nCumulative\nTotal\nTotal Dividend Payments\nthrough 1Q 2015 2,3\n$136.42,3\n$0.03\n2008\n$1.9\n1Q152\n2013\n$82.5\n1\t Treasury draw requests are shown in the period for which requested and do not include the initial $1.0 billion liquidation \npreference of Fannie Mae’s senior preferred stock, for which Fannie Mae did not receive any cash proceeds. The payment of \ndividends does not offset prior Treasury draws.\n2\t Fannie Mae expects to pay a dividend for the first quarter of 2015 calculated based on our net worth of $3.7 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2014 less the applicable capital reserve amount of $1.8 billion. \n3\t Amounts may not sum due to rounding.\n4\nWe also have made important progress toward our goals in conservatorship to build new \ncapabilities that increase the safety and soundness of the housing finance system and \nencourage more market participation. For example, we remain committed to working with \nthe Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to develop a new common securitization  \nplatform, intended to simplify and modernize the way mortgage loans are securitized. \nWe also have been working with FHFA and the industry on new financial and operational \nrequirements for mortgage insurers that should dramatically improve mortgage insurance \nrisk management. Additionally, we are working to develop a single common mortgage- \nbacked security for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with a goal of increasing liquidity in the \nhousing finance market.\nIn 2014, we completed four new credit risk transfer transactions, which transferred a portion \nof the existing credit risk on our single-family guaranty book of business to private investors. \nBy increasing the role of private capital in the mortgage market, these transactions help to \nreduce taxpayer exposure from borrower defaults.\nThese initiatives, along with others we are pursuing, are designed to ensure that we effec-\ntively respond to changes in the market and build a stronger, more sustainable system. \nWhile the future of our company remains uncertain, we are looking ahead and improving \nthe way we operate with FHFA’s guidance to support America’s housing. We have made \nsignificant progress, reflecting the commitment of Fannie Mae employees to strengthen our \ncompany’s foundation, provide reliable access to affordable mortgage credit, and supply the \ntools and resources the industry needs for the long term.\n446K\nrental units\nOur $434 billion in liquidity in 2014 enabled:\nhome\npurchases\n887K\nmortgage\nrefinancings\n937K\n6\nFocused on Our Partners\nAs America’s housing industry continues to adjust and grow in the wake of the financial \ncrisis, Fannie Mae has re-committed to being the partner of choice in the secondary \nmortgage market. To do so, we will provide a superior customer experience that allows \nour lenders to work quickly and with certainty. Customer service is not new to us – our \ndedicated account teams work closely with our lenders every day, continually learning how \nthey operate and finding constructive solutions that deliver the full value of Fannie Mae. \nHowever, we are making it easier, more efficient, and more effective to do business with \nus, today and in the future, so our customers can serve the market safely and profitably.\nLowering repurchase risk understandably \nis a priority area for our customers. \nBased on their feedback, we have made \nsignificant changes to our representation \nand warranty framework to help lenders \nreduce their repurchase risk relating to \nloans they deliver to us. We provided \nlenders with greater clarity on the circum-\nstances that would result in a repurchase \nrequest. We are expediting our review \nof newly acquired performing loans to \nidentify loan defects earlier in the process \nand are making more frequent use of the \nalternatives to repurchase specified in our \nSelling Guide. \nAlso, we are providing lenders with training and feedback to help them resolve origination \nissues and reduce loan origination defects, and our innovative tools such as EarlyCheck™ \nand Collateral Underwriter™ are helping them deliver loans that meet our eligibility standards. \nWe see Collateral Underwriter as a major step toward mitigating repurchase risk for lenders. \nWith access to the same system we use internally at Fannie Mae to analyze appraisals, \nlenders can compare a property against our database and against other pieces of information \nwe have about the home and neighboring properties, helping them to address appraisal \nquality before delivering a loan to Fannie Mae – at no additional cost. By reducing the poten-\ntial for repurchases down the road, our tools provide lenders the clarity they need to serve the \nmarket.\nWe provide best-in-class products and resources that meet the needs of our customers, \nlarge and small. In fact, we are the preferred partner for smaller originators, including com-\nmunity banks, credit unions, independent mortgage bankers, and state and local Housing \nFinance Agencies. Our account teams are focused on the specific and unique business \nneeds of our smaller customers to help them meet their objectives.\nAdditionally, through our capital markets activities, we enable lenders to replenish their funds \nand originate new loans through a variety of options. Lenders can sell their loans to Fannie Mae \nVisit fanniemae.com/progress \nto learn more about our lender \nresources.\n9\nfor cash through our robust cash window or swap their loans for Fannie Mae mortgage- \nbacked securities (Fannie Mae MBS), which lenders can keep for their portfolio or sell to \ninvestors. Under our early lender funding programs, we purchase whole loans or pools \nof loans on an accelerated basis – this allows lenders to receive quicker payment, which \nreplenishes their funds and enables them to originate more single-family loans.\nFannie Mae also is a leading source of financing and securitization for quality rental housing \nin America. Our multifamily business is taking steps to continue to strengthen relationships \nwith our lenders, provide financing solutions to help them compete in the market, and create \nsecurities that are attractive to our investors. In 2014, we provided $28.9 billion in multifamily \nfinancing to serve multiple segments of the multifamily market, resulting in 446,000 units \nof rental housing. We accomplished this in partnership with our 24 approved Delegated \nUnderwriting and Servicing (DUS®) lenders, who delivered nearly 100 percent of Fannie \nMae’s 2014 multifamily loan acquisitions.\nFor 27 years, Fannie Mae’s unique DUS program has played a significant role in the multi-\nfamily housing market, providing lenders and borrowers with efficient and reliable financing \nsolutions every day while helping to protect taxpayers. Our DUS program was the original \n“skin in the game” model in mortgage lending, with our DUS lenders sharing the first loss \non the loans they originate and deliver to us. Through this shared-risk model, Fannie Mae \nprovides certainty and speed of execution, competitive pricing, and strong credit risk man-\nagement to our multifamily lenders and their borrowers.\nAt Fannie Mae, we recognize and appreciate what is most important to our lender partners. \nWe are focused on providing the products, services, and clarity they need to serve their \ncustomers and reduce barriers to lending to qualified borrowers.\nmultifamily \nloans 60+ days \ndelinquent as of \n12/31/2014\nin total financing \nprovided to the \nmultifamily market \nin 2014\n$28.9B\n+85%\n0.05%\nof rental units financed \nin 2014 were affordable \nfor those at or below \narea median income\nCommitted to Doing More\nFannie Mae serves an essential role in the market – and that role is as important now as it \nwas in 1938, when we were created to bolster the nation’s housing system during the Great \nDepression. It’s why we exist today under FHFA supervision. We help to ensure that quali-\nfied home buyers across the nation have access to mortgage credit in good times and bad, \nand that quality, affordable rental housing is available. With the support of our conservator, \nwe can be counted on when people need us most.\nWe are proud to be the leading provider of liquidity to America’s housing and mortgage market. \nIn 2014, our approximately $434 billion in financing enabled 887,000 home purchases, 937,000 \nmortgage refinances, and 446,000 units of rental housing from coast to coast. We also remain \na leading provider of the prepayable 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which protects homeowners \nfrom fluctuations in interest rates. This is just one of the ways we are helping people who \nare financially ready to own a home while limiting risk to lenders and taxpayers. Additionally, \nthrough our unparalleled loss mitigation platform and broad suite of loan workout options, \nin 2014 we provided approximately 165,000 solutions that helped families in distress avoid \nforeclosure.\n11\n10k\n30k\n60k\nSupporting the Housing Market in 2014 \nWe enabled people to buy, refinance, and rent \nhomes across the United States.\n13\nWhile we have made good progress, we are not satisfied with the status quo – we strive \nfor continuous improvement through innovation to help more creditworthy borrowers buy \nhomes. We are focused on doing more to expand access to mortgage credit in a responsible \nand sustainable manner.\nTogether with our partners we are working to reduce the barriers that qualified borrowers \nmight face. For instance, by providing greater clarity on our representation and warranty \nframework, we intend to help mortgage originators serve the market more confidently and \nlend to the full scope of our credit parameters, enabling more creditworthy borrowers to \nqualify for a mortgage loan. \nAdditionally, we expanded our low down payment offerings in 2014 to re-introduce loans with \na 97 percent loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. These loans are available to first-time home buyers \nwho qualify for a mortgage but don’t have the resources to make a large down payment. \nHigher LTV products are not new at Fannie Mae – the 97 percent LTV option builds on our \nsuccessful lower down payment programs offered through state Housing Finance Agencies, \nand we have offered a 5 percent down payment option for more than 25 years. \nWe believe these products will encourage \nlenders to make credit available to a \nlarger number of creditworthy borrowers. \nImportantly, we conduct this business in a \nsafe and prudent way, having eliminated \nthe practices that led to significant prob-\nlems leading up to the housing crisis. For \ninstance, we require borrowers to purchase \nmortgage insurance on most of our higher \nLTV ratio loans, which reduces taxpayer \nexposure. Also, home purchase loans we \nacquire must have appropriate documen-\ntation and income verification – we do not \naccept so-called “no-doc” or “low-doc” \nloans*. \nThese are just a few of the actions we \nare taking to reduce barriers to affordable \nmortgage credit in a responsible manner. \nThere is no single solution that will help us \nachieve this – rather, it requires sustained \nfocus fueled by constant innovation. Fannie \nMae is proud to lead the way.\n17.4M\nsingle-family \nconventional loans\nas of 12/31/14\nare long-term \nfixed-rate mortgages\nare current \non payments\n78%\n96%\n*Refi Plus™ loans are subject to different eligibility requirements.\n14\n3,000+\n Fannie Mae employees \n23,115 volunteer hours \n$148,000+\n raised \n11 nonprofits benefitted\nGiving Back to Our Communities\nAs part of our efforts to build a better housing finance system, we strive to help the thousands \nof individuals and families who don’t have a place to call home. Fannie Mae has a strong \ntradition of giving back to those in need, particularly the homeless and those at risk of becom-\ning homeless. Our employee volunteer and philanthropic efforts, which build and strengthen \nrelationships with the communities we serve, are aligned with the company’s priority to ensure \nthat affordable housing is accessible in all communities across the country at all times.\nOur workforce rallies together throughout the year to support homeless service providers, \nstaff borrower outreach events, rebuild homes in hard-hit neighborhoods, refurbish inner-city \nschools, host food and clothing drives for struggling families, and much more. In 2014, more \nthan 3,000 Fannie Mae employees raised more than $148,000 and volunteered a total of \n23,115 hours on a wide range of projects and initiatives. \nAdditionally, our Help the Homeless Program provides a fundraising model that benefits \norganizations working to prevent and end homelessness across the country. Each year, \nFannie Mae employees join thousands of others across the country who support the \nprogram by participating in community events, making donations, and volunteering their \ntime and energy. The program has proudly distributed more than $100 million to Help the \nHomeless nonprofit beneficiaries since 1988.\nIn 2014\nwww.fanniemae.com/progress\n3900 Wisconsin Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC 20016\n© 2015 Fannie Mae.

These expectations are \nforward-looking statements based on our current assumptions regarding numerous factors. Our actual results and future expectations may differ materially from our current \nexpectations as a result of home price changes, unemployment rates, other macroeconomic and housing market variables, future legislative or regulatory requirements, \nborrower behavior, and many other factors, including those discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of and elsewhere in our 2013 Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements \nare representative only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events \nor otherwise, except as required under the federal securities laws.\nPublished February 24, 2014\n2\nHome. \nIt is a word that can mean very dif-\nferent things to different people. For \nhomeowners and renters, perhaps it \nis a place to raise a family. For those \nwho build or invest in housing, it can \nbe a career or a way to improve the \nlocal community. For those without \na home, it might be the dream of a \nsafe, warm place to live. \nWhatever “home” means to you, \nFannie Mae is committed to making \nit possible.\nIn our role in the mortgage market, we \nprovide affordable, large-scale access \nto housing in America. We do this \nby buying the loans that banks and \nother lenders originate so they have \nthe funds to issue new loans, which \nenables more people across the coun-\ntry to buy, refinance, or rent a home. \nThis process helps create stability \nin the housing market and attracts \nglobal capital to America. For the indi-\nvidual, it means affordable mortgage \ncredit is available across the country \nat all times. For our nation, it means a \nmore stable economy.\nWe are proud of the role we play in \nAmerica’s housing finance system. \nMore importantly, we are improving \nthe way we perform that role in \norder to meet the needs of an \never-changing market. Fannie Mae \ntoday is different than it was in the \npast. In the last five years, we have \nsupported the housing recovery, \nstrengthened our company, and \nimproved the way we and industry \npartners do business. We are \nworking to fix the defects of the old \nsystem and we are helping to build \na safer, more sustainable housing \nfinance system for the future. In \n2013, we continued to see our \nprogress against these priorities.\nOur financial performance has \nimproved significantly during the \npast few years. In 2013, we reported \n$84.0 billion in net income and $38.6 \nbillion in pre-tax income, the highest \nannual income and annual pre-tax \nincome in our company’s history. The \nfourth quarter of 2013 marked our \neighth consecutive quarterly profit, \nand we expect to be profitable for the \nforeseeable future. We expect our \nannual earnings to remain strong over \nthe next few years, but substantially \nlower than in 2013. \nFannie Mae's profits go back to \ntaxpayers. We will have paid a total \nof $121.1 billion in dividends to \nTreasury as of March 2014, which is \napproximately $5 billion more than \nwe have received in taxpayer support.\nAdditionally, we have strengthened \nour underwriting and eligibility \nstandards to promote sustainable \nhomeownership and stability in the \nhousing market. Roughly 77 percent \nof the loans in our $2.9 trillion \nsingle-family guaranty book were \npurchased between 2009 and 2013, \nand we expect this new single-family \nbook will be profitable over its \nlifetime. Our multifamily credit book \nalso continues to perform well – as it \ndid throughout the credit crisis – with \nextremely low delinquency rates. \nWe also have helped people keep \ntheir homes or otherwise avoid \nforeclosure by completing more \nthan 1.5 million workout solutions \nsince 2009. In 2013, we completed \n234,000 foreclosure prevention \nsolutions. Less than 1 percent of the \nsingle-family loans in our book went \ninto foreclosure in 2013, and we \nstrive to help every at-risk family find \nan alternative to foreclosure.\nWe have made significant progress \nin improving our business and we \nremain committed to working with \nFHFA to meet its strategic goals for \nour conservatorship. We are seeing \nthe results of our efforts to build a \nstrong new book of business and \nwe continue to work on our goal \nof improving the nation's housing \nfinance system, to make it safer and \nmore transparent for consumers, \nlenders, and investors. We are \npassionate about this. We know \nthat when the market works well, \ncommunities across our country \nprosper. That is why “home” is better \nwhen Fannie Mae is part of it.\nIn the pages of this report, we share \nour progress and the evidence of our \ndedication to support the recovery, \nimprove our company, and make \nhousing better.\nTimothy J. Mayopoulos \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, \nFannie Mae\n4\nSingle-family conventional guaranty book of business:\nIn 2013, we reported:\n6\nTo understand where Fannie Mae is today, it is important to recall why \nthe company was created. During the Great Depression, our country \nrecognized the need for a reliable, steady source of funding for housing. \nBefore Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Administration were \ncreated, people had no consistent access to affordable mortgage credit.\nFor more than 75 years, we have helped millions of Americans find \nhome – whether they are in big cities or small towns, whether \nthey prefer to rent or buy, and whether the economy is good or \nbad. In 2008, the global financial crisis hit and the federal \ngovernment stepped in to support the U.S. housing \nfinance system. For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \nthis meant federal conservatorship. This was a \nprofound event – conservatorship marked \nthe end of the old Fannie Mae.\n8\nA “different” Fannie Mae has played \nan essential role in responding to \nthe housing crisis and contributing to \nthe economic recovery. Fannie Mae \nserves an important function: to fund \nour nation's housing market.\nIn the wake of the crisis, we have \nremained the leading source of liquid-\nity for housing in the U.S. We have \nfunded approximately $4.1 trillion in \nloans since 2009, providing access \nto homes for millions of families. \nNotably, we are the largest source \nof the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, \nhelping to ensure these mortgages \nare widely available to families \nwanting to buy a home.\nThe loans in our new single-family \nguaranty book of business – those \nwe have acquired since 2009 – have \na strong overall credit profile and \nnow comprise 77 percent of our \nsingle-family guaranty book. Single-\nfamily loans that are 90 days or more \ndelinquent on payments or in the fore-\nclosure process decreased to 2.38 \npercent of our book as of December \n31, 2013 – a share that has declined \neach quarter since it peaked at 5.59 \npercent in February 2010.\nWe are focused on improving the \nhousing market and making homes \nmore attainable and more affordable. \nOur role in the housing market helps \nstabilize the market and brings global \ncapital to America. For the individual, \nthis means access to affordable mort-\ngage credit in all economic cycles. \nWhile the future of our company \nremains uncertain, we have made \ntremendous progress since 2009. \nOur financial performance has \nimproved, we have helped struggling \nhomeowners while building a stron-\nger business, we are contributing to a \nsafer housing finance system for the \nfuture, and we have paid billions of \ndollars in dividends to Treasury. \nUltimately, our goal is a sustainable \nhousing market that enables people \nto buy or rent a home anywhere in \nthe country at all times. \n10\nCumulative Total \nInitial Liquidation Preference\n$1.0 \nTreasury Draw Requests 1\n$116.1 \nTotal Senior Preferred \nStock Outstanding\n$117.1 \nDraw Request from Treasury\n(in billions)\n$60.0\n2009\n$15.2\n2008\n$15.0\n2010\n$25.9\n2011\n$0.0\n2012\n1Q13\n$0.0\n$0.0\n2Q13\n4Q13\n$0.0\n$0.0\n3Q13\nTBD\n1Q14\nDividend Payment to Treasury\n(in billions)\n$8.6\n4Q13\n$7.2\n1Q142\n$0.03\n2008\n$2.5\n2009\n$7.7\n2010\n$9.6\n2011\n$11.6\n2012\n$4.2\n1Q13\n$59.4\n2Q13\n$10.2\n3Q13\nCumulative \nTotal\nTotal Dividend Payments\nthrough Q1 20143\n$121.1\nDuring the past five years, we have changed our company \nas the quality of our book of business and our financial \nperformance have improved significantly.\nIn 2013, we reported net income of $84 billion and $38.6 \nbillion of pre-tax income – the highest annual income \nand annual pre-tax income in our company’s history. Our \nnet income for 2013 was positively affected by several \nsignificant factors, such as the release of the valuation \nallowance against our deferred tax assets, a significant \nincrease in home prices, and the large number of \nresolution agreements we entered into during the year. As \nof December 31, 2013, we have been profitable for eight \nconsecutive quarters, and we expect to remain profitable \nfor the foreseeable future. We expect our annual earnings \nto remain strong over the next few years, but substantially \nlower than 2013. (See our 2013 Form 10-K filed with the \nSEC on February 21, 2014 for more information on our \n2013 financial results and our expectations for our future \nfinancial results.) \nAs of our March 2014 dividend payment to Treasury we will \nhave paid a total of $121.1 billion in dividends – approx-\nimately $5 billion more than we have received in support \nfrom taxpayers. (The dividends we pay to Treasury do not \noffset our prior draws from Treasury.)\nBut our progress is about much more than profit alone. \nWe are making housing better by improving loan quality, \nadvancing appropriate underwriting standards, better bal-\nancing risk, and enhancing how we collect and report data. \nThe important changes we have made to our company and \nthe way we and our partners do business are contributing \nto a safer, more sustainable system for future generations. \nTREASURY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS\ntREASURY Draws\n(1)\t Treasury draw requests are shown in the period for which requested and do not include the initial $1.0 billion liquidation preference of Fannie Mae’s senior preferred \nstock, for which Fannie Mae did not receive any cash proceeds. The payment of dividends does not offset prior Treasury draws.\n(2)\t Our dividend for the first quarter of 2014 is calculated based on our net worth of $9.6 billion as of Dec. 31, 2013 less the applicable capital reserve amount of $2.4 billion.\n(3)\t Amounts may not sum due to rounding.\n12\nBANK\nHOMEBUYER\n– Avg. 744 FICO \n   (620 min. at origination*)\n– Avg. 67% LTV \n   (mark-to-market)\nProtecting the homebuyer, the lender, and the community.\nIn order to sell loans to Fannie Mae, lenders \nmust follow our eligibility and underwriting \nguidelines, which emphasize loan quality.\nTo qualify for a Fannie Mae loan, a \nhomebuyer must meet minimum credit \nrequirements to help ensure they are on \nsolid financial footing and can afford their \nloan for the long term.\n*limited exceptions exist\nAs of December 31, 2013\nof December 31, 2013. Given the \nsolid credit risk profile of these loans \nand based on their performance to \ndate, we expect these loans in the \naggregrate will be profitable over \ntheir lifetime.\nWe also continue to mitigate credit \nlosses on our single-family loans by \naiding homeowners in distress due to \nthe financial crisis. For example, we \nhelp eligible Fannie Mae borrowers \nrefinance into more sustainable loans \nthrough the Administration’s Home \nAffordable Refinance Program® \n(HARP®), and we work with servicers \nto offer loan modifications – changes \nto the homeowner’s loan terms – that \ncan significantly reduce monthly \nmortgage payments. (Read more \nabout our commitment to help strug-\ngling homeowners on page 24.)\nOur initiatives to improve loan quality \nand lending standards have made a \ndifference. On our new single-family \nbook of business (loans acquired \nsince January 1, 2009), the serious \ndelinquency rate was 0.33 percent \nas of the end of 2013*. By the end of \n2013, approximately 95.5 percent of \nFannie Mae’s 17.6 million single-fam-\nily conventional loans were current \nand the share of seriously delinquent \nloans had declined for 15 straight \nquarters. Overall, less than 1 percent \nof our single-family loans went into \nforeclosure in 2013.\nAll of this means that fewer \nhomeowners are missing mortgage \npayments. In addition to helping \nfamilies and neighborhoods, this \nalso benefits America’s housing and \neconomic recoveries. \n*The serious delinquency rates for \nloans acquired in more recent years \nwill be higher after the loans have \naged, but we do not expect them to \napproach the levels of the December \n31, 2013 serious delinquency rates \nof loans in our legacy book of busi-\nness (loans acquired prior to 2009).\nAt Fannie Mae, we work to help protect homeowners while \nensuring broad access to mortgage credit. \nFor instance, we have introduced new underwriting and \neligibility standards – checks and balances, essentially – \nto improve the sustainability of loans that lenders deliver \nto us. Also, loan quality initiatives such as the Uniform \nMortgage Data Program® and our EarlyCheckTM service are \ndesigned to improve the loan process by delivering better, \nmore consistent information earlier. \nSince buying a home is the largest financial commitment \nmany people will make, we also have established reason-\nable and sound credit criteria that homebuyers must meet \nin order to be eligible for a loan. These changes help to \nensure borrowers are better prepared to afford their homes \nfor the long term, which helps to stabilize the market.\nAs a result of these efforts, the quality of our single-family \nloans has improved over the past few years. The loans \nwe have acquired since January 1, 2009 accounted for \n77 percent of our overall single-family guaranty book as \nAs of December 31, 2013\n“NEW” BOOK\nLoans acquired since 2009, with stronger standards.\n77%\n23%\n14\nA good place to live is central to our national aspiration. \nFannie Mae helps make that possible. We exist to ensure \nthere are adequate funds in the market so that people can \nbuy, sell, or rent a home anywhere in our nation and during \nall economic cycles.\n16\nWe help people access the funds they need when they are \nready for a home. Our mission is to support liquidity and \nstability in the secondary mortgage market (where existing \nmortgage-related assets are bought and sold) and to \nincrease the supply of affordable housing. \nAlthough we do not issue loans directly to borrowers, \nwe buy and securitize mortgages from banks and other \nlenders – for home renters, homebuyers, or homebuilders. \nThis helps to keep the market functioning. \nWe take great care to ensure that the mortgages we \nacquire from banks and lenders are of high quality. To \ndo this we put quality control at the very beginning of the \nprocess, which reduces risk and provides greater clarity, \nquality, and consistency in the mortgage process. \nAfter we acquire the loans, we typically bundle them into \nmortgage-backed securities (MBS) that we sell to inves-\ntors, which attracts the world’s capital to America. In 2013, \nwe provided $797 billion in liquidity to the market, which \nenabled people to complete 1 million home purchases and \n2.6 million refinances and attain 507,000 units of quality, \naffordable rental housing. \nWe also provide funding to the mortgage market through \nshort-term financing and other activities. Through our \ncapital markets activities, we enable lenders to replenish \ntheir funds and issue new loans. Lenders can sell their \nloans to Fannie Mae for cash or swap their loans for Fannie \nMae MBS, which lenders can keep for their portfolio or sell \nto investors.\nIt all adds up to more people having a good place to  \ncall home.\n“The liquidity provided  \nby market investors \nhelps us provide our \nmembers with sustainable \nmortgage products.”\n— Richard F. Morris, Vice President of Pricing/GSE, \nNavy Federal Credit Union\nWe help people access the \nfunds they need when  \nthey are ready for a home. \nThat’s why we’re here.\n18\nAt Fannie Mae, we are proud to \nbe the country’s leading source of \nsingle-family financing. But more \nimportantly, we are focused on \nperforming this role responsibly.\nWe understand the importance of \nenabling people to buy homes they \ncan afford for the long term, and \nwe support sustainable mortgage \nlending practices that minimize \nrisk for homebuyers. For instance, \nFannie Mae is the leading provider \nof the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage – \nAmerica’s most preferred mortgage. \nFixed-rate mortgages protect home-\nowners from interest rate swings and \noffer predictable monthly payments \nfor the life of the loan. These features \nhelp people to plan their finances, \nraise families, start businesses, and \nbuild a foundation for retirement. \nNinety-seven percent of consumers \nbelieve it is important for long-term \nfixed-rate mortgages to be available \nin the U.S. However, most private \nlending institutions do not want to \ntie up their money for such long \nperiods. As a government-sponsored \nenterprise, Fannie Mae is able to \nprovide a steady source of funding \nfor long-term mortgage products, \nensuring they remain accessible  \nto homebuyers. \nAs of December 31, 2013, roughly \n72 percent of the loans in our \nsingle-family book of business were \nlong-term fixed-rate mortgages. \nWhat’s more, the share of seriously \ndelinquent loans in our single-family \nbook of business dropped to 2.38 \npercent as of December 31, 2013. \nThis marked the 15th consecutive \nquarterly drop in our single-family \nserious delinquency rate. \nWe’ve made great progress to help \npromote sustainable homeownership. \nThese improvements are a direct \nresult of the significant changes we \nhave made at Fannie Mae. \n“Our country is unique in having a liquid secondary market for 30-year fixed-rate \nmortgages, the product of choice for most borrowers because of the affordability and \nsafety it provides. Fannie Mae’s commitment to housing finance, both providing liquidity \nand supporting the capital markets with its securities, helps make this product of choice \na reality. Caliber Home Loans’ partnership with Fannie Mae has helped us accomplish \nour mission of guiding families in achieving their dream of homeownership.”\n– Joe Anderson, CEO, Caliber Home Loans, Inc.\nAccording to our National Housing Survey,  \n86 percent of consumers prefer to own a home because \nthey want protection against rent increases and they \nbelieve owning is a good long-term investment.\n20\nDUS MBS produced by our lenders \nwith demand from the institutional \ninvestor community is key to pro-\nviding liquidity for multifamily loans. \nThrough our Guaranteed Multifamily \nStructures (Fannie Mae GeMS™) \ndeals, we package groups of DUS \nMBS together to create larger, more \nliquid deals that are appropriate for a \nbroader array of investors. In 2013, \nwe expanded our investor base and \nhelped bring private capital back \ninto the housing finance system by \nissuing 10 GeMS deals, totaling more \nthan $10 billion in principal balance. \nIn addition to responding to the needs \nof renters and our DUS Lenders, our \nborrowers’ interests remain top of \nmind. In 2013, we began offering loan \nterms of up to 12 years in response \nto concerns about rising interest \nrates. Innovative new approaches like \nthe 12-year term and GeMS deals \ngenerate additional demand for DUS \nMBS, helping to keep rates stable for \nmultifamily borrowers.\nAt Fannie Mae, we understand that \n“home” means something different \nfor every family. According to our \nmonthly National Housing Survey, \nroughly one in six Americans prefers \nthe financial and lifestyle benefits of \nrenting over owning. As the leading \nprovider of liquidity to America’s \nmultifamily mortgage market, we \nprovide access to quality, affordable \nrental housing in small towns and big \ncities alike. \nIn 2013, we financed 507,000 rental \nunits by providing $28.8 billion in \nliquidity to the multifamily market. \nMore than 85 percent of these units \nwere affordable to individuals and \nfamilies earning at or below the \nmedian income in their area. \nWorking together with our Delegated \nUnderwriting and Servicing (DUS®) \nlender partners, we serve multiple \nsegments of the market, including \naffordable, student, and seniors \nhousing, manufactured housing \ncommunities, conventional loans, \nand loans to large institutional \nborrowers that cover multiple prop-\nerties. Fannie Mae’s DUS program \nis a unique and proven shared-risk \nmodel in the commercial mortgage \nindustry, providing effective, \nefficient, and reliable financing \nsolutions for multifamily housing \nlenders and borrowers. In 2013, \nFannie Mae DUS Lenders delivered \n99 percent of our multifamily loan \nacquisitions, helping to house hun-\ndreds of thousands of people across \nthe country. And, the high-quality \nloans in our multifamily book of \nbusiness, which totaled more than \n$200 billion in 2013, continue to \nperform well – loans that are 60+ \ndays delinquent made up only 0.10 \npercent of our multifamily guaranty \nbook of business as of December \n31, 2013.  \nThe majority of loans we financed in \n2013 were delivered through MBS \nexecution.

These options are specifically designed to \nhelp borrowers avoid foreclosure.\nWe also continue to work with our servicing partners to \nimprove their foreclosure prevention results. For instance, \nwe provide free training to servicers and rolled out inno-\nvative new industry standards with FHFA and Freddie Mac \nto make servicing processes simpler and more effective. \nWe also offer educational resources for homeowners to \nhelp them understand their options, and we encourage \nsingle-point-of-contact practices so that struggling borrow-\ners are not bounced around to multiple representatives. \nOur goal is to reach at-risk homeowners much earlier so \nthat, together, we can find a way to help them keep their \nhome. Since 2009, through all of these efforts, we have \ncompleted more than 1.5 million workouts to help home-\nowners avoid foreclosure. We appreciate that we could not \nhave fulfilled this role without the support of taxpayers, \nand we are focused on repaying their investment through \nour dividend payments to Treasury and by helping to build \na better housing finance system.\nWhile the housing market is improving, we recognize that \nmuch work remains. People are still struggling. Fannie Mae \nis focused on helping the thousands of individuals and \nfamilies who are faced with the prospect of losing their \nhome. We have seen firsthand how devastating foreclosure \ncan be to homeowners, both emotionally and financially. \nWe also see how each foreclosure affects more than just \none household – it can ripple across communities, jeopar-\ndizing home prices and crippling neighborhoods. \nIn 2013, through our suite of loan workout options, we \nhelped approximately 234,000 struggling homeowners to \nstay in their homes or find alternatives to foreclosure. For \ninstance, we helped homeowners with serious long-term \nhardship (such as illness or loss of income) to change \nthe terms of their loan into something more affordable by \ncompleting 160,000 loan modifications. \nWe have helped approximately 1 million homeowners \nto refinance their loans through our Refi Plus™ initiative \nin 2013, bringing the total to approximately 3.9 million \nsince the program’s inception. Refi Plus, which includes \nthe Administration’s Home Affordable Refinance Program \n(HARP), provides expanded and streamlined opportunities \nfor homeowners to take advantage of historically low inter-\nest rates. As a result of Refi Plus, homeowners’ monthly \nmortgage payments were reduced by an average of $223 \nin 2013. \nAdditionally, we enable servicers to offer forbearance to \nunemployed homeowners or those affected by natural \ndisasters in order to help them avoid foreclosure. Our \nother foreclosure alternatives include short sales, where a \nborrower who owes more than the home is worth may be \nIn 2008, homeowner Paul was injured at work and put on disability \n– then the recession hit, followed by widespread layoffs and declining home values, and Paul lost his job. He and \nhis wife, Cherie, were just staying afloat on her income. Fortunately, they reached out to their mortgage company \nabout HARP and were able to lower their monthly mortgage payments by $305 a month. “The extra money helps \nout tremendously,” says Paul.\n26\nAs we continue to support the recovery, we are joining in \nreforms to create a safer U.S. housing finance system – \none that enables families to buy homes while protecting \ntaxpayers from too much risk.\n28\nThrough 2013, we reached important \nmilestones with the support of our \nconservator to help build a more \ntransparent and sustainable  \nhousing system.\nFor example, under FHFA’s guidance, \nwe are partnering with Freddie Mac to \ndevelop a new mortgage securitiza-\ntion platform. In addition, we issued \nour first credit-risk-sharing securities \ntransactions in 2013 to help encour-\nage private market participation. \nWe are also working on additional \ninitiatives to prepare our business \nand infrastructure for potential future \nchanges in the structure of the U.S. \nhousing finance system.  \nThese are important results but we \nare committed to doing much more. \nAs we look ahead, we will continue \nto work closely with FHFA to improve \nour business and invest in initiatives \nto help ensure America’s housing \nsystem is safer and more sustainable \nfor generations to come. No matter \nwhat that future system looks like, \nthe people of Fannie Mae are proud \nto support it.\n30\nAs part of our focus on supporting the housing \nrecovery and helping to build a better housing \nfinance system, we continue our proud tradition \nof giving back to communities and families.\n32\nOn any given day in the U.S., more than 1 million people do \nnot have a place to call home. At Fannie Mae, we have a \nlong-standing commitment to combating homelessness.\nSince 1988, our Help the Homeless Program has provided \na fundraising model that benefits organizations who serve \nthe homeless or those at risk of becoming homeless – the \nprogram has raised and distributed more than $100 million \nto Help the Homeless nonprofit beneficiaries. Each year, \nthousands of people get involved by participating in a com-\nmunity event, making a donation, or volunteering their time. \nIn 2013, we continued to drive participation in and around \nthe cities where we live and work – Atlanta, Chicago, \nDallas, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC. \nBy coordinating Help the Homeless as a far-reaching, \ncommunity-focused initiative through various local events, \nwe are able to raise critical funding and awareness of \nhomelessness within our own neighborhoods.\nWhile Fannie Mae concluded its grant-making role at the \nend of 2013, our employees continue their dedication to \nthe issue of homelessness through fundraising, volunteer-\nism, and awareness-building activities.\n“Since 2007, we have expanded from housing five clients in \nPermanent Supportive Housing to our current 34 – with a \ntotal of 60 clients housed over that time. Our participation in \nHelp the Homeless has allowed us to expand this program, \nbuild a reserve account, and share our message with \nthousands of our neighbors in Arlington, Virginia every year.” \n– Kathleen Sibert, Executive Director of \nArlington Street People’s Assistance Network (A-SPAN)\n34\nOur employee volunteer efforts are aligned with Fannie \nMae’s business and help to build and strengthen relation-\nships with the communities we serve. \nWhether supporting homeless service providers, staffing \nforeclosure prevention events, rebuilding homes in hard-hit \nneighborhoods, refurbishing inner-city schools, or hosting \nfood and clothing drives for struggling families, our employ-\nees are passionate about giving back to those in need. \nThroughout 2013, more than 2,000 Fannie Mae employees \nvolunteered nearly 18,000 hours on a wide range of proj-\nects and initiatives to benefit local nonprofit organizations.\nWe always push ourselves to make a bigger difference in \nthe community. In 2013, we launched “7 Days to SERVE” \n– a concentrated week of community service activities. \nThrough the program, Fannie Mae employees had the \nopportunity to volunteer in coordinated hands-on events \nand skills-based projects (such as leading financial literacy \nsessions), all in support of nonprofits who share our focus \non tackling the nation’s housing challenges.\n36\nThanks for giving us the \nopportunity to spend \nsome of our time being \nof service to the \ncommunity. \n– Yolanda Jordan, Chicago\nIt was my first SERVE \nevent and I can't wait for \nthe next one. \n– Saima Aslam, Reston\nBefore leaving, I got a \nhug from one of the kids \nand it warmed my heart.\nAbigail Maraya, \nWashington, DC\n*based on the Independent Sector’s 2012 value of volunteer time estimate.\n5,700+\ntotal hours of \nvolunteer service =\n$126,198\nin service to our \ncommunity partners*\nAtlanta\nSORTED:\n12,190 LBS OF FOOD  \nPROVIDED:\n  8,126 MEALS\nWashington, DC Metro Area\nMADE & DISTRIBUTED:\n960 BAG LUNCHES\n280 LITERACY KITS\nPhiladelphia\nACCOMPLISHED:\nHANDWRITTEN \nNOTES\nBREAKFAST \nBAGS\n300+\n200+\nDAYS\nHOMELESS \nDAILY \n4\n200\nFt.

    "text": "PROGRESS REPORT\n2012\n2  |\nWe also recognize that we have an outsized role \nin the market. In a properly functioning housing \nmarket‚ Fannie Mae would play a smaller role. \nHowever‚ private capital is naturally opportunistic‚ \nparticipating when times are good and moving to \nthe sidelines when conditions are bad. Almost ﬁ ve \nyears after the onset of the ﬁ nancial crisis‚ we see \nlimited evidence of substantial private capital ready \nto share mortgage credit risk. By keeping funds \nﬂ owing when other sources are not‚ we support \nthe housing recovery‚ which strengthens the U.S. \neconomy.\nIn addition to ensuring the availability of residential \nmortgage credit‚ we are committed to doing our \npart to improve the mortgage ﬁ nance system. What \ndoes a better system look like? It strikes the right \nbalance‚ providing access to mortgage credit while \nprotecting society from too much risk. It oﬀ ers \neveryone more visibility up front and an ability \nto price for the risk that is inherent in mortgage \nﬁ nance. We are working to establish and implement \nindustry standards‚ develop better tools to price \nand manage credit risk‚ build new infrastructure to \nensure a liquid and eﬃ  cient market‚ and facilitate \nthe collection and reporting of data for accurate \nﬁ nancial reporting and improved risk management.  \n2012 MARKED A TURNING \nPOINT AT FANNIE MAE‚ \nthe year in which the fruits of four years of labor \nmanifested in tremendous progress. We have taken \nactions to improve our ﬁ nancial performance‚ build a \nproﬁ table new book of business‚ and reduce losses on \nour legacy book. In 2012‚ we reported $17.2 billion in \nnet income‚ the largest net income in the company’s \nhistory. Our proﬁ ts go back to taxpayers. Through \nMarch 31‚ 2013‚ Fannie Mae paid taxpayers $35.6 \nbillion in dividends. We expect to remain proﬁ table for \nthe foreseeable future.\nFannie Mae today is about more than turning a \nproﬁ t. We are an essentially diﬀ erent company with \ndiﬀ erent leadership and our priorities are aligned \nwith the public interest. We ﬁ ll the indispensable \nrole of enabling families to buy‚ reﬁ nance‚ or \nrent a home. To do so‚ Fannie Mae has provided \n$3.3 trillion in mortgage credit since 2009. We \nappreciate that we could not fulﬁ ll this important \nrole without taxpayer support.\nMESSAGE\nFROM\nTHE CEO \n  PROGRESS REPORT |  3\nUltimately‚ we measure our progress not only by \npaying taxpayers and improving the housing ﬁ nance \nsystem‚ but also by the diﬀ erence we make in \npeople’s lives. This is where the value we deliver \nand our values intersect.  \nFor example‚ we help families avoid foreclosure \n– more than 1.2 million since 2009. We work \nwith mortgage servicers to reach at-risk \nhomeowners early‚ helping them stay in their \nhomes. Unfortunately‚ many properties still enter \nforeclosure and‚ as the investor‚ the homes come to \nus. In these cases‚ we help stabilize neighborhoods \nby caring for the properties we own and selling \nthem for the highest possible price. This enables \ncommunities to rebound and the neighbors to \nrebuild equity more quickly.\nFannie Mae also provides opportunity for new \nhomeownership‚ especially for middle-income \nfamilies‚ and we enable millions of reﬁ nances \nevery year‚ which often result in a lower monthly \nmortgage payment. Between 2009 and 2012‚ Fannie \nMae reﬁ nanced more than 9.7 million mortgages‚ \nincluding more than 1.3 million loans reﬁ nanced \nthrough the Home Aﬀ ordable Reﬁ nance Program \n(HARP). Borrowers who reﬁ nance through HARP \nhave an average weekly savings of approximately $82. \nThis savings would more than pay for the average \nhousehold’s weekly clothing costs or about 50 \npercent of a household’s weekly food consumption. \nWe also fund the market for quality‚ aﬀ ordable \nrental housing. It all adds up to more Americans \nhaving a good place to call home.\nThe people behind our progress are my colleagues \nat Fannie Mae. Collectively‚ we are intent on \nachieving something remarkable. More than half of \nour employees joined Fannie Mae since we entered \nconservatorship‚ signing up for the daunting tasks \nof turning around our company‚ responding to \nan unprecedented housing crisis‚ supporting our \ncountry’s recovery‚ and making housing better for \nthe future. The other half stuck with us through \ncrisis and uncertainty for the same important \nreasons. Together‚ the people of Fannie Mae are \npart of the solution.  \nIn the pages of this report‚ we will drill down into \nthe progress Fannie Mae made in 2012. We have \ncome a long way‚ but there is much important work \nahead. While the housing market’s turnaround \nin 2012 appears poised to continue in 2013‚ the \nrecovery is fragile and uneven. Many borrowers \nremain at risk in underwater mortgages and it will \ntake years to rebuild lost value. Unanswered policy \nquestions fuel uncertainty in the market. Against \nthis backdrop‚ we maintain a focus on making \nmeaningful‚ lasting contributions for the housing \nsystem and for the American people.\nTimothy J. Mayopoulos\nPresident and Chief Executive Oﬃ  cer‚ Fannie Mae\n4  |\nFANNIE MAE \nPERFORMANCE\n  PROGRESS REPORT |  5\nAMERICA’S HOUSING RECOVERY\nrequires a stable‚ steady strategy. At Fannie Mae‚ we \nare committed to supporting the housing recovery \nand building a better housing ﬁ nance system for the \nfuture.\nTo best meet the needs of the market‚ our business \nis organized into three segments: Single-Family‚ \nMultifamily‚ and Capital Markets. Although each \nsegment plays a distinct role in providing liquidity‚ \nall three engage in complementary activities \nto ensure Fannie Mae oﬀ ers the best products‚ \nsolutions‚ and customer service to our partners \nwhile helping millions of middle-income families \nbuy‚ reﬁ nance‚ or rent a home.\nBacking America’s Preferred Mortgages \nLong-term ﬁ xed-rate mortgages are America’s \npreferred mortgage oﬀ ering – approximately 74 \npercent of homebuyers say they prefer them over \nother mortgage products. These mortgages‚ such \nas the 30-year ﬁ xed-rate loan‚ provide millions \nof homeowners with certainty and predictability \nin their monthly payments. At the end of 2012‚ \n“The 30-year ﬁ xed-rate mortgage \ncontinues to play a vital role in our \nbusiness. This important product \nprovides strong stability at all \npoints in the mortgage chain. \nWe, and most importantly our \ncustomers, derive a tremendous \namount of value from this type \nof loan. As our primary partner in \nthe 30-year mortgage business, \nFannie Mae is crucial in helping us \nensure we can continue to make \nthis popular option available to \nAmerican homebuyers.” \n– Breck Tyler, President, \nTrustmark Bank\napproximately 72 percent of Fannie Mae’s single-\nfamily conventional guaranty book of business was \ncomposed of long-term ﬁ xed-rate mortgages.\nSupporting Sustainable \nHomeownership\nLaying the foundation for a better housing ﬁ nance \nsystem requires a collective eﬀ ort to establish \nand implement industry standards‚ develop better \nmechanisms to price and manage credit risk‚ build \nnew infrastructure for accessing global capital \nmarkets‚ and facilitate the collection and reporting \nof data for accurate ﬁ nancial reporting and improved \nrisk management. This foundation must be capable \nof attracting and retaining suﬃ  cient capital to fund \nour existing and future housing needs.\nThe environment that led to the housing crisis was \ncharacterized by an erosion of credit standards‚ an \nindustry chasing volume‚ and poor visibility into loan \nquality. At Fannie Mae‚ we are charged with being a \nresponsible standard setter. We‚ and the industry as \na whole‚ have taken action to evolve standards in a \ndirection to help borrowers sustain homeownership.\nThe aim of robust underwriting standards and \nveriﬁ cation of the creditworthiness of borrowers \nis not to eliminate any possibility that a mortgage \nwill fail over its lifetime. As we work toward a better \nsystem‚ creditors make reasonable and rigorous \nassessments of one’s ability to pay (including one’s \n6  |\nincome‚ net worth‚ and other obligations) and credit \nhistory‚ backed by documented evidence. This \ncollective assessment will help match a qualiﬁ ed \nborrower with an appropriate product and rate. \nBut borrower eligibility is only as eﬀ ective as the \nloan origination process that follows. To ensure \neveryone operates on a level playing ﬁ eld‚ we \nworked with our partners to launch industry-wide \ntools and solutions. These initiatives are designed \nto clarify and streamline the underwriting process‚ \ncreate consistent sets of required loan-level and \nproperty appraisal data‚ and enforce checks-and-\nbalances on loans before they are delivered to our \ndoorstep. We also implemented a revised post-\npurchase review process to conﬁ rm the accuracy \nof loan data‚ eligibility‚ and much more. The goal \nis greater transparency to enable all parties to see \nand evaluate risk early in the loan manufacturing \nprocess. \nIn 2010, Fannie Mae joined FHFA, Freddie Mac, and \nother industry participants to launch the Uniform \nMortgage Data Program® (UMDP®), which provides a \ncommon framework for improved and consistent data \nstandards and collection processes. The program \ndeﬁ nes all required appraisal data, allows for the elec-\ntronic collection of that data, and provides a common \nset of required data for single-family loans that are\ndelivered to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nComplementing the UMDP is Fannie Mae’s Early-\nCheck™ service, which helps lenders to identify \nand correct potential eligibility and data issues \nearly in their processes and before they deliver\nloans to the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).\nTogether, these improved mortgage data and delivery \nstandards support our lender partners and enable the \nGSEs to better manage risk, beneﬁ ting everyone with a \nrole in the mortgage market.\nSINGLE-FAMILY SDQ RATE HAS \nDECLINED 11 CONSECUTIVE \nQUARTERS\nSingle-Family Loans prior to 2009\nSingle-Family Loans 2009 through \nDecember 31, 2012\n66%\n34%\nNEW SINGLE-FAMILY BOOK OF \nBUSINESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012\nIS STRONG, PROFITABLE, AND \nGROWING\nThese new tools have contributed to a signiﬁ cant \ndecline in the post-purchase review defect rate. \nThe improvements in underwriting and eligibility \nstandards also have led to a proﬁ table new book of \nbusiness at Fannie Mae‚ which now accounts for 66 \npercent of our overall single-family guaranty book \nof business. Our single-family serious delinquency \n(SDQ) rate has declined 11 consecutive quarters and \nis substantially lower than private-market levels. \nOverall‚ 94 percent of our 17.5 million single-family \nloans were current as of the end of 2012.\n5.47%\n3.29%\n1Q10\n4Q12\n  PROGRESS REPORT |  7\nAttracting Private Capital to the \nSingle-Family Market\nFannie Mae has fulﬁ lled an essential role over \nthe last ﬁ ve years by providing liquidity when \nother funding sources exited the secondary \nmortgage market. Along with the Federal Housing \nAdministration‚ Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s \ncombined market share was nearly 85 percent\nin 2012.\nWhile we’ve taken steps to sustain critical liquidity \nfor the market‚ we continue to be concerned about \nmarket capacity and our outsized role. We’ve seen \nsigniﬁ cant deconsolidation in the industry as major \nmarket participants have pulled back or left the \nmarket entirely. Moreover‚ lenders tell us regulatory \nconcerns‚ repurchase risk‚ and lack of underwriting \ncapacity limit their willingness to extend credit.\nTo encourage private capital participation in the \nsecondary market and reduce our market share in \na safe and sound manner‚ Fannie Mae has made \na number of key pricing changes since 2008. Our \nstrategy focuses on pricing for risk and responding \nto changing market dynamics. For example‚ the \nguaranty fees we require on loans are designed \nto align with the risk of the loan and earn an \nappropriate market return. In 2012‚ we raised our \nguaranty fees to create competition‚ entice private \ncapital back to the market‚ and reduce potential \nfuture risk to taxpayers. \nTo date‚ private capital largely remains on the \nsidelines and Fannie Mae continues to provide \nliquidity to meet market demand.\nReﬁ nancing into Safer, \nMore Aﬀ ordable Terms \nFor many homeowners‚ especially those with \nadjustable-rate loans or who bought when interest \nrates were higher‚ reﬁ nancing is a valuable option \nthat helps lower monthly payments‚ shorten the \nloan term‚ or move into a more secure ﬁ xed-rate \nloan. We work with more than a thousand lenders \noﬀ ering a variety of reﬁ nancing options to help \nhomeowners take advantage of lower interest \nrates and enjoy a more aﬀ ordable and sustainable \nmortgage loan. We ensure a steady stream of credit \navailability for reﬁ nanced mortgages‚ helping to \nkeep the market liquid and active. Between 2009 \nand 2012‚ Fannie Mae reﬁ nanced more than 9.7 \nmillion mortgages.\nOur Reﬁ  Plus™ initiative provides expanded \nreﬁ nance opportunities for eligible Fannie Mae \nborrowers and includes the Administration’s Home \nAﬀ ordable Reﬁ nance Program (HARP). (Learn more \nabout HARP on page 13.) The initiative is designed \nto make more homeowners eligible to reﬁ nance \nand to make the process faster and easier for \nboth borrowers and lenders. In general‚ Fannie \nMae requires borrowers to be currently employed‚ \ncurrent on their mortgage‚ and have an acceptable \npay history during the past 12 months.\nIn 2012‚ Fannie Mae acquired approximately 1‚117‚000 \nreﬁ nanced loans through Reﬁ  Plus. Borrowers either \nreduced their monthly payments or switched to a \nsafer‚ more sustainable mortgage. Overall‚ reﬁ nancings \ndelivered to Fannie Mae through Reﬁ  Plus in the fourth \nquarter of 2012 reduced borrowers’ monthly mortgage \npayments by an average of $237.\n8  |\nOur website KnowYourOptions.com provides tools \nand resources to help homeowners evaluate \nwhether reﬁ nancing is the right option for them. \n(Learn more about Know Your OptionsTM on page 13.)\nA Critical Backstop in the \nMultifamily Market\nWith approximately one-third of all Americans \nrenting a home at the end of 2012‚ and with many \nindicators suggesting even greater demand for \nrental housing in the coming years‚ the market \nrequires reliable partners to provide ﬁ nancing across \nthe spectrum of multifamily rental housing needs. \nWorking through our Delegated Underwriting and \nServicing (DUS®) lender partners‚ Fannie Mae helps \nto meet this need. During the crisis‚ we never left \nthe market – we were‚ and remain today‚ a vital \nsource of ﬁ nancing in the multifamily rental sector‚ \nSUPPORTING THE\nMULTIFAMILY MARKET IN 2012\n$33.8\napproximately\nof loans\ndelivered through \nmortgage-backed \nsecurities execution\nunits financed\n98%\nof units affordable\nto families at or\nbelow area\nmedian income\nmore \nthan 85%\n560,000\nbillion \nin financing\nproviding much-needed capital as other institutional \nsources fully re-emerge.

DUS lenders are pre-approved to underwrite \nand service loans on our behalf‚ which provides \ncertainty‚ speed of execution‚ and competitive pricing. \nIn exchange‚ the lenders share risk of potential loss over \nthe life of the loan‚ which encourages strong credit risk \nmanagement.\nIn 2012‚ our DUS lenders delivered 98 percent of the \ncompany’s multifamily loan acquisitions. Importantly‚ \nwhile our multifamily market share increased when \nprivate capital left the market‚ it has now returned to \nthe pre-recession level of approximately one-fourth\nof the market.\n“The DUS program continues to \ndeliver exceptional value for our \ncustomers. It does so because \nit reﬂ ects Fannie Mae’s ongoing \nsensitivity to the dynamics of \nthe multifamily market as well \nas its commitment to serving the \nneeds of worthy borrowers who \nprovide aﬀ ordable rental housing \nthroughout the country. As a DUS-\napproved lender, I appreciate \nFannie Mae’s high standards, its \ntimely execution, and its trust in \nits partners. Thanks in large part \nto the reliable, consistent liquidity \nthat Fannie Mae provides, the \nmultifamily market has proven \nremarkably resilient.” \n– Grace Huebscher, President and CEO, \nBeech Street Capital\nFannie Mae provided $33.8 billion in ﬁ nancing to\nthe multifamily market in 2012. Approximately $33.1 \nbillion of that total was issued as multifamily MBS, \nup from $23.8 billion in 2011. We also continue to \nprovide additional liquidity to the market through \nour Fannie Mae Guaranteed Multifamily Structures \n(GeMSTM) program. First introduced in 2011, the GeMS \nprogram packages individual MBS into larger, more \nliquid structured products. Fannie Mae GeMS struc-\ntures oﬀ er collateral diversity to investors, larger in-\nvestment size, and a variety of maturities. In 2012, we \nsecuritized more than $10 billion through the GeMS \nprogram. Attracting additional investors to our MBS \nproducts provides more consistent execution for our \nlenders and lowers costs for multifamily borrowers.\nMeeting Specialty Housing Needs\nWe are committed to providing ﬁ nancing for \nquality homes to meet the needs of the rental \nhousing market. In 2012‚ we continued our support \nof rental housing for the workforce‚ senior citizens‚ \nstudents‚ and families.\n• $3.8 billion in multifamily aﬀ ordable housing‚ which \nprovides ﬁ nancing for rent-restricted properties \nand properties receiving other federal and state \nsubsidies\n• $3 billion in small loans (loans of up to $3 million‚ \nor $5 million in high-cost areas)\n• $11.6 billion in large loans (loans $25 million or \nhigher)\n• $912 million in manufactured housing \ncommunities\n• $712 million in student housing\n• $1.8 billion in structured transactions\n• $1.2 billion in seniors housing\n10  |\nCapital Markets: Investment in \nthe Housing Market\nFannie Mae’s Capital Markets group supports our \nSingle-Family and Multifamily businesses and oﬀ ers \na range of products and services that enable us to \nprovide liquidity to lenders and the housing ﬁ nance \nsystem. Through Capital Markets‚ we purchase \nindividual loans from lenders and assist them with \nselling mortgage-backed securities (MBS) into the \nsecondary market‚ and also provide lenders with \ntemporary funding services.\nWhen lenders originate loans‚ they generally have \nthree “execution” options: sell the loans individually \nfor cash through our whole loan conduit‚ aggregate \nor “pool” the loans and swap them for an MBS‚ or\nretain the loans on their balance sheet.\nThrough the whole loan conduit‚ nearly 1‚100 lenders \ndeliver loans to us in exchange for cash‚ which they \ncan use to issue more loans to homebuyers and \nmultifamily property owners. Typically‚ smaller and \nmid-sized lenders who lack the scale or experience \nto participate in the MBS market use this service.\nAlternatively‚ lenders can deliver loans to us \nin exchange for an MBS that they hold as an \ninvestment‚ sell into the secondary market‚ or sell \nto us. This execution‚ known as a “swap‚” typically is \nused by larger lenders who sell a signiﬁ cant portion \nof their loan originations into the secondary market. \nIn 2012‚ approximately 145 Fannie Mae lenders \nissued MBS.\nThrough our Capital Markets activities‚ Fannie Mae’s \nSingle-Family and Multifamily business segments \ncan provide our lender customers with a suite of \nbest execution options – choices in how to sell the \nmortgages they originate so they can replenish their \nfunds‚ make more loans‚ and hedge their risks in a \ncost-eﬃ  cient manner. The Capital Markets group also \nhelps to promote general liquidity in the mortgage \nmarket.\n  PROGRESS REPORT |  11\nHELPING \nHOMEOWNERS \nAND \nNEIGHBORHOODS\n12  |\nIN OUR ROLE in the secondary mortgage \nmarket‚ we do not lend directly to consumers – but \nwe keep them top of mind in everything we do. This \nbecame particularly important in the wake of the \nﬁ nancial and housing crisis‚ which left millions of \nAmericans facing foreclosure.\nWorking Together to Keep People \nin Their Homes\nFannie Mae has taken a leading role in helping families \navoid foreclosure and in stabilizing communities that \nhave felt the heavy burden of a struggling housing \nmarket. Over the past few years‚ we have developed \nnew solutions and protocols to incent servicers –\nthird-party entities that work directly with borrowers on \nmortgage payments and terms – to help borrowers‚\nand to hold the servicers accountable for their \nperformance.\nEvery day counts when a family is facing foreclosure. \nTogether with FHFA and Freddie Mac‚ we created \nthe Servicing Alignment Initiative (SAI) – a joint eﬀ ort \nto ensure servicers are better and more consistently \nprepared to help at-risk homeowners by reaching \nthem sooner and keeping them engaged throughout \nthe process. As part of SAI we established Servicer \nTotal Achievement and Rewards™. STAR™ combines \noperational assessments of the servicer’s capabilities \nwith an objective‚ balanced scorecard that measures \nthe servicer against its peers.\nIn cooperation with our servicers and bolstered \nby STAR‚ SAI helps families to stay in their homes \nwhenever possible or ﬁ nd suitable options that \nprevent or limit the long-term ﬁ nancial fallout of a \nforeclosure. For example‚ we emphasize the loan \nmodiﬁ cation as an eﬀ ective way for a servicer to \nadjust a homeowner’s existing loan so that the terms \nare more aﬀ ordable and sustainable. Our modiﬁ cation \n“During the recession, my \nhusband and I lost our jobs \nand weren’t able to sell our \nhouse because we were too far \nunderwater. We kept up with \nour mortgage payments and \neventually found new work, but \nour personal ﬁ nancial situation \ntook a big hit. \nWhen HARP 2.0 came out, it \neﬀ ectively saved our home and \nour retirement planning. Even \nthough our loan-to-value ratio was \n150 percent, HARP enabled us to \nreﬁ nance into a 15-year ﬁ xed-rate \nmortgage with a signiﬁ cantly lower \ninterest rate. Our monthly payment \nwent up by $50 a month, but we \nwere able to cut the loan term in \nhalf. Now we can look at retirement \nin a diﬀ erent way because we know \nour home will be paid oﬀ . And that’s \na terriﬁ c feeling.“\n– Kim Kaplan, Homeowner\nprograms are designed to meet a borrower’s \nneeds while accommodating the servicer’s \ncapabilities. Since 2009‚ we have completed 879‚000 \nmodiﬁ cations.\nHomeowners in distress can learn about loan \nmodiﬁ cations‚ reﬁ nances‚ and other options at \nour Mortgage Help Centers‚ 12 on-the-ground \nfacilities located in the hardest hit communities \nacross the country.

By the \nend of 2012‚ nearly seven out of 10 borrowers we \nhelped through the centers were able to stay in \ntheir homes. To broaden the reach of the centers‚ \nwe established the Mortgage Help Network (MHN). \nThe MHN is a partnership with 13 HUD-approved \nhousing counseling agencies that provide access \nto counseling and loss mitigation solutions in \nadditional hard-hit metropolitan areas‚ and by \nphone in all 50 states through the 1-888-995-HOPE \nhotline.\nIn addition to our brick-and-mortar facilities‚ we oﬀ er \ninnovative online tools such as KnowYourOptions.com.\nThe website provides a one-stop resource for people \nwho are interested in getting a mortgage‚ reﬁ nancing \na mortgage‚ and for those interested in renting a home. \nThe loan lookup tool on KnowYourOptions.com helps \nhomeowners determine if Fannie Mae owns their loan‚ \nand the site provides resources and information for \nhomeowners in distress to take action early. \nHAMP: Fannie Mae participates in the Adminis-\ntration’s Home Aﬀ ordable Modiﬁ cation Program \n(HAMP), launched in 2009 to help more troubled \nborrowers beneﬁ t from the loan modiﬁ cation option.\nUnder HAMP, eligible borrowers can have their loans \nmodiﬁ ed to an aﬀ ordable, sustainable level, which is \nbased on the family’s monthly income. Since 2009, \nmore than 1.1 million homeowners have received\npermanent modiﬁ cations through HAMP.\nHARP: Fannie Mae also participates in the Administra-\ntion’s Home Aﬀ ordable Reﬁ nance Program (HARP), \navailable to those with GSE-owned or guaranteed loans. \nUnder HARP, homeowners whose homes have dropped \nin value (and therefore do not qualify for traditional reﬁ -\nnancing options) have the opportunity to reﬁ nance into \na safer loan and take advantage of lower interest rates. \nIn late 2011, the program was expanded to increase \naccess for more responsible homeowners. For exam-\nple, certain risk-based fees were removed for those \nwho reﬁ nanced into shorter-term mortgages, and \nthe 125 percent loan-to-value ceiling was lifted. From \nthe program’s inception in 2009 through December \n2012, eligible homeowners have received more than\n2.1 million HARP reﬁ nancings. \nHARP REFINANCING SAVINGS COMPARED WITH\nAVERAGE HOUSEHOLD WEEKLY EXPENDITURES\n14  |\nWe expanded KnowYourOptions.com in 2012 to \nbetter support all borrowers – not just those facing \nforeclosure. A new reﬁ nance overview has helped \nhomeowners learn whether they’re eligible to lower \ntheir interest rate or adjust their loan term and type \nof mortgage‚ which can improve their ﬁ nancial \nsituation. We also made it easier for potential \nhomebuyers to ﬁ nd out what opportunities may \nbe available to them and to learn how to prepare \nfor homeownership‚ which helps to prevent future \ndelinquencies and foreclosures. Since we launched \nit in 2010‚ the website has received approximately \n15 million page views and 2 million unique visitors.   \nImproving Alternatives to Foreclosure\nSadly‚ some homeowners simply cannot aﬀ ord to \nstay in their homes. In these circumstances‚ we \nprovide alternatives that allow for a graceful exit \nand help borrowers repair their credit sooner than \nthey would following a foreclosure. A short sale‚ \nfor example‚ allows a homeowner to settle their \nmortgage debt in most cases even if the amount \nowed is greater than what the house is worth. \nDepending on the circumstances‚ the borrower \nmight also qualify for ﬁ nancial assistance to help \nthem transition to a more aﬀ ordable place to live.\nShort sales are an important tool in the ﬁ ght against \nforeclosure – but we’ve heard from our industry \npartners about the roadblocks they’ve faced when \nexecuting short sales. To combat this‚ we rolled out \nan assistance and escalation program that helps \nresolve delays during the handling of short sale \noﬀ ers on Fannie Mae mortgages. In early 2013‚ we \nsigniﬁ cantly enhanced our capability and broadened \naccess through the use of our HomePath.com website. \nThe new page provides information to both borrowers \nand real estate professionals (REPs)‚ including a link \nfor REPs to escalate a case directly to Fannie Mae \nfor issues including list price assistance‚ valuation \ndisputes‚ and non-responsive servicers.

When a home with a loan owned \nby Fannie Mae goes into foreclosure‚ we acquire the \nproperty‚ which then becomes part of our inventory. \nIn this scenario‚ we continue to work with the aﬀ ected \nborrower by oﬀ ering post-sale loss mitigation \noptions. For example‚ we oﬀ er relocation assistance \nin exchange for leaving the property in a clean and \nacceptable condition. We also oﬀ er the option to \nrepurchase the home after foreclosure for the total \ndebt owed.\nFannie Mae does not walk away from a home. We \nwork to sell our properties for the highest possible \nprice‚ which helps to stabilize neighborhoods and \nreduce taxpayer losses. Through our First Look™ \ninitiative‚ we give preference to buyers over \ninvestors for the ﬁ rst 15 days a property is listed (30 \ndays in Nevada). We also repair our homes when \nappropriate‚ which increases the likelihood that they \nwill be ﬁ nanceable and appealing to families. In 2012‚ \nwe repaired more than 80‚000 properties‚ and the \nvast majority of our total inventory was sold through \nlocal real estate professionals (agents and brokers). \nWe also work extensively with municipalities‚ \nnonproﬁ ts‚ and land banks to help them achieve \ntheir objectives for properties that aren’t suitable for \ntypical borrower retail sale.\nAll of our properties available for sale are listed on \nHomePath.com‚ an easy-to-use property search \nand information website for both borrowers and \nreal estate professionals. Potential homebuyers \nFirst Look™ is a key component of our foreclosure \nproperty sales strategy.

We have a proud tradition of \nvolunteerism‚ and we provide grants to support the \nhousing recovery and to serve the homeless and those \nat risk of becoming homeless. \nWe’re sensitive to our obligation to be responsible \nstewards. Our community investment model‚ strategy‚ \nand budget are approved by our regulator‚ and we \nmonitor investments to ensure our funds are used \nappropriately and in a way that will produce the most \nmeaningful impact. We also ensure that our charitable \ninvestments are aligned with our business priorities‚ \nand our community engagement eﬀ orts are targeted \nprimarily to nonproﬁ t organizations that are helping \ncommunities and markets in need.\nIn 2012‚ Fannie Mae made charitable investments \nnationwide in support of the housing recovery. The key \nprojected outcomes from our 2012 funding include:\n• Foreclosure prevention counseling for more than \n215‚000 at-risk borrowers‚ helping more than \n65‚000 families avoid foreclosure\n• Post-foreclosure counseling and transitional \ncounseling for more than 6‚700 homeowners\n• Acquisition of more than 4‚000 foreclosed \nproperties to help stabilize neighborhoods \n• Rehabilitation of more than 2‚400 foreclosed \nproperties and the sale/leasing of over 3‚000 \nFannie Mae properties \n• Pre-purchase education for more than 38‚000 \npotential homebuyers‚ and post-purchase and \nﬁ nancial literacy counseling for over 19‚000 \n• Acquisition‚ development‚ and preservation of \nmore than 20‚000 aﬀ ordable housing units\n• Preservation and development of more than \n16‚000 units of permanent supportive housing\nOur employee volunteer eﬀ orts also are aligned with \nand deepen the impact of Fannie Mae’s business while \nhelping to build and strengthen relationships with the \ncommunities we serve.

Whether \nstaﬃ  ng foreclosure prevention events or rebuilding \nhomes in hard-hit neighborhoods‚ refurbishing inner-\ncity schools‚ donating money to homeless service \nproviders‚ or hosting food and clothing drives for \nstruggling families‚ our employees rolled up their \nsleeves and donated time and money to give back to \nthose in need. \nFor example‚ 143 Fannie Mae employees donated 1‚015 \nvolunteer hours in 2012 to help struggling homeowners \navoid foreclosure through the Making Home Aﬀ ordable \nProgram‚ Know Your Options‚ and other outreach \nevents. More than 1‚060 employees volunteered nearly \n7‚500 hours to help prevent homelessness across \nthe country. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy‚ Fannie \nMae employees contributed $9‚845 to the Blanket the \nCity program‚ which provided blankets and towels for \naﬀ ected families‚ and donated approximately $35‚000 \nto the American Red Cross to help provide shelter‚ \nfood‚ and other assistance.\nIn 2013‚ Fannie Mae employees will participate in\n“7 Days to SERVE” – a corporate-wide engagement \nprogram that emphasizes seven days of community \nvolunteerism. Through the initiative‚ employees can \nparticipate in coordinated hands-on or skills-based \nvolunteer service projects that address America’s \nhousing-related issues. The program bolsters our \nyear-round commitment to community service through \nprograms such as Help the Homeless®.\n25 Years of Helping the Homeless\nSince 1987‚ Fannie Mae’s Help the Homeless \nProgram has provided a fundraising model to \nhelp build the capacity of nonproﬁ ts working to \nprevent and end homelessness. Each year‚ tens of \nthousands of people get involved by participating \nin a community walk‚ making a donation‚ being \na sponsor‚ or volunteering their time to support \norganizations dedicated to serving those who are \nhomeless or at risk of becoming homeless.\nHelp the Homeless remains the nation’s largest \nfundraising eﬀ ort focused on homelessness. First \nlaunched as a Washington‚ DC-centered initiative‚ \nFannie Mae has distributed approximately $100 \nmillion to nonproﬁ t partners while raising awareness \nof the issue of homelessness around the country.\nIn 2012‚ we continued our support for nonproﬁ ts \nbeyond the Washington‚ DC area and successfully \nintroduced the program in ﬁ ve new cities – Atlanta‚ \nChicago‚ Dallas‚ Philadelphia‚ and Los Angeles.\nBy expanding Help the Homeless into a broader \ncommunity-focused initiative that facilitates \nneighborhood and city walks‚ we are able to raise \nmoney and awareness directly in the communities in \nwhich we live and work. \n18  |\nOur ﬁ rst year of a decentralized Help the Homeless \nprogram made an impact. We held approximately 700 \nlocal walks‚ bringing together neighbors‚ Fannie Mae \nemployees‚ and beneﬁ ciary organizations committed \nto ending homelessness in their communities. Our \nnonproﬁ t partners successfully transitioned to the \nnew model and found innovative ways to engage their \ncommunities. Together‚ more than 100‚000 people \nparticipated‚ raising $4.5 million in 2012.\nA Diverse Workforce Supporting a \nDiverse Housing Market\nIn 1992‚ we launched Fannie Mae’s Oﬃ  ce of Diversity \nand Inclusion to foster a culture of inclusion and \nrespect for all Fannie Mae employees. The goal was \nto create an environment where our employees \nalways feel conﬁ dent bringing their whole selves \nto work and can contribute their diverse ideas \nand perspectives to help address our complex \nbusiness challenges and meet the needs of our \nconstituencies.\nTwenty years later‚ the concept of diversity and \ninclusion is fully ingrained into who we are and what \nwe do. We all come with diﬀ erent backgrounds‚ \nexperiences‚ and abilities – and we value and \nleverage those diﬀ erences within the company and \noutside our walls. This has enabled us to make a \nbigger diﬀ erence in the lives of the diverse families \nand communities we serve.\n“Demand for our services has \nincreased three-fold in the last \nfour years. Without partners like \nthe Help the Homeless Program, \nwe would not be able to serve \nthese additional people.”\n – Michael Bartscherer, Martha’s Table\n  PROGRESS REPORT |  19\nFORWARD\n20  |\n  PROGRESS REPORT |  20\nWE UNDERSTAND that Fannie Mae is \nnot going to continue in the future as it operated in \nthe past and that its role and structure will change \nover time. We are determined to restore trust and \ncreate a positive legacy. We will do this through our \nperformance. The best way to show our gratitude \nfor the support we received is to pay America – \nliterally as we return our proﬁ ts to taxpayers‚ and \nin spirit as we move forward in a way that will \nimprove the housing experience in our country for \ngenerations to come.\n  PROGRESS REPORT |  21\nThis report includes our expectations regarding our future financial results, the outcome of our efforts to lay the foundation for \na better housing finance system, our ability to pay taxpayers, and the growth, profitability, and caliber of the loans in our new \nsingle-family book of business. These expectations are forward-looking statements based on our current assumptions regarding \nnumerous factors, including future home prices. Our actual results and future expectations may differ materially from our current \nexpectations as a result of home price changes, unemployment rates, other macroeconomic variables, government policy, social \nbehaviors, and many other factors, including those discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of and elsewhere in our annual report on \nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. These forward-looking statements are representative only as of the date they \nare made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events \nor otherwise, except as required under the federal securities laws.\n22  |\n© 2013 FANNIE MAE\nTRADEMARKS OF RESPECTIVE OWNERS\nPUBLISHED APRIL 2, 2013"

These estimates,\nforecasts, expectations, and statements are forward-looking statements and are based on the\ncompany's current assumptions regarding numerous factors, including assumptions about future\nhome prices and the future performance of its loans. \nThe company's future expectations, as well as actual outcomes, may differ materially from what is\nexpressed in these statements as a result of many factors, including home price changes; interest\nrate changes; unemployment; other macroeconomic variables; government policy matters; changes\nin generally accepted accounting principles; credit availability; social behaviors, including increases in\nthe number of underwater borrowers who strategically default on their mortgage loan; the volume of\nloans it modifies; the nature, volume, and effectiveness of its loss mitigation strategies and activities;\nmanagement of its real estate owned inventory and pursuit of contractual remedies; changes in the\nfair value of its assets and liabilities; impairments of its assets; the adequacy of its loss reserves;\nfuture legislative or regulatory requirements that have a significant impact on the company’s\nbusiness such as a requirement that the company implement a principal forgiveness program; future\nupdates to the company’s models relating to loss reserves, including the assumptions used by these\nmodels; changes to the company’s accounting policies; failures by its mortgage seller-servicers to\nfulfill their repurchase obligations to it; its ability to maintain a positive net worth; effects from\nactivities the company takes to support the mortgage market and help homeowners; the\nconservatorship and its effect on the company’s business; the investment by Treasury and its effect\non the company’s business; changes in the structure and regulation of the financial services\nindustry; the company’s ability to access the debt markets; disruptions in the housing, credit, and\nstock markets; government investigations and litigation; the performance of the company’s\nservicers; conditions in the foreclosure environment; and many other factors. Changes in the\ncompany's underlying assumptions and actual outcomes, which could be affected by the economic\nenvironment, government policy, and many other factors, including those discussed in the “Risk\nFactors” section of and elsewhere in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended March 31, 2012 and its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and\nin its other filings made with the SEC from time to time, could result in actual results being materially\ndifferent from what is set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statements made by Fannie Mae speak only as of the date on which they are\nmade. Fannie Mae is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter\nits forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, or\notherwise.\nMay 1, 2012\n© 2012 Fannie Mae\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n3\nIn 2011, we focused on achieving results in three critical areas: building a strong new book\nof business, helping distressed homeowners and stabilizing communities, and improving\nour company to contribute to a sustainable housing market for the future. We made\ntremendous progress. At the end of 2011, our new book was strong, profitable, and growing.\nOur loss mitigation and foreclosure prevention efforts helped limit losses on the legacy\nbook of business and our credit-related expenses decreased substantially. \nSince 2009, we have provided $2.3 trillion in liquidity to the single-family and multifamily\nmarkets. We’ve helped 6.6 million households refinance and enabled 2 million buyers to\npurchase a home. We’ve provided financing for over 1 million units of quality rental \nhousing and enabled nearly 1 million homeowners to avoid foreclosure. \nThese are important results but we are committed to doing more. Our progress is a product\nof the diligence and determination of our Board, our management, and our employees. \nFannie Mae employees approach each day and each challenge with tremendous resolve to\nhelp build a better housing finance system.\nWe are proud of our employees for their unrelenting focus. The work they do affects real\npeople in the real world. This report tells the stories of how we are putting our resources to\nwork for the industry and for the American people.\nPhil Laskawy\nChairman of the Board\nMike Williams\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nA Message from \nPhil Laskawy \nand Mike Williams\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n4\nA strong, stable housing market is critical to America’s eco-\nnomic recovery. Fannie Mae, a $3 trillion financial services\nbusiness, is the leading provider of mortgage credit. As a\nsecondary market participant, we do not lend directly to\nconsumers. We are a government-sponsored enterprise\n(GSE) chartered by Congress to keep liquidity flowing to\nmortgage lenders such as local and national banks, thrifts,\ncredit unions, and other financial institutions. We purchase\nand guarantee their loans to enable families to buy homes,\nrefinance their existing mortgages, or access affordable\nrental housing. We package the loans into bonds and sell\nthem to global investors.\nIn 2008, the federal government placed Fannie Mae under\nconservatorship with a mandate to continue day-to-day \nefforts to support the U.S. housing market, while delivering\ninitiatives to speed the housing recovery and contribute to \na sustainable housing finance system. We have made \nsubstantial progress. Fannie Mae has responded effectively\nto the housing crisis by ensuring funding for the market, \nassisting distressed homeowners, stabilizing neighborhoods,\nreducing credit losses on the legacy (pre-2009) book of\nbusiness, and building a high quality new book. As a result,\nthe company’s financial performance has improved signifi-\ncantly since entering conservatorship. \nLet’s take a closer look at the outcomes of our mandate \nto ensure funding for the market. As the leading source \nof liquidity for the single-family and multifamily mortgage \nmarkets, Fannie Mae provided $2.3 trillion in liquidity from\n2009 through 2011 to enable homeownership and afford-\nable rental housing. \nI Fannie Mae’s conventional single-family book of busi-\nness had 17.7 million loans totaling approximately $2.8\ntrillion in unpaid principal balance. Ninety-three percent\nof these loans were current and performing as of the\nend of 2011.\nI The company purchased or guaranteed more than \n8.5 million single-family mortgage loans. This enabled\n6.6 million mortgages to be refinanced and almost \n2 million households to purchase a home. The new book\nof business comprises more than half of the total \nsingle-family book. \nI Fannie Mae provided approximately $62 billion in \nfinancing for more than 1 million units of quality rental\nhousing. More than 85 percent of those units are \naffordable to families earning at or below the median \nincome in their area. Through Fannie Mae’s early \nfunding products, we provided more than $319 billion in\nshort-term liquidity for small and medium-sized lenders\nso they could continue to meet the demands of their\ncustomers. \nThese data points represent 2009-2011 unless \notherwise noted.\nPriorities \nand Progress\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n5\nIn 2011, the housing market and mortgage finance industry\nremained under pressure as the U.S. economy continued its\nslow recovery. Against this backdrop, Fannie Mae worked to\nmeet the urgent needs of the current market while building \na stronger foundation for housing in the future. The com-\npany’s priorities and the results of our actions aligned with\nthis dual responsibility: \nI Keep funds flowing. We serve as a stable source of liquid-\nity for the purchase of new homes and refinancing of \nexisting mortgages, as well as the financing of multifamily\nrental housing. In 2011, Fannie Mae accounted for an \nestimated 41 percent of the single-family market and an\nestimated 34 percent of the multifamily market. We guar-\nanteed or purchased approximately $653 billion in loans,\nenabling lenders to finance roughly 2,680,000 single-\nfamily conventional loans and loans for 423,000 units in\nmultifamily properties. \nI Assist distressed homeowners. Millions of homeowners\nstruggle to keep their homes. Everyone loses when \nfamilies are faced with a foreclosure. The impact is high \nfor homeowners, their neighborhoods, the market, and\ntaxpayers. \nFannie Mae has the largest foreclosure prevention \noperation in America. We have assisted almost 1 million\nhomeowners to retain their homes or otherwise avoid\nforeclosure since 2009.\nTo reach families in need, we created innovative out-\nreach and education programs, including brick-and-\nmortar and online solutions. In 12 hard-hit communities\nacross America, we established Fannie Mae Mortgage\nHelp Centers, where homeowners work one-on-one \nwith counselors to determine the best solution for \ntheir individual needs. Our online educational initiative\nKnowYourOptions.com provides homeowners with \nthe information they need to make informed housing\ndecisions. \nOur efforts to assist distressed homeowners are \nunprecedented in scope. They not only help families, \nbut also stabilize communities and enable Fannie Mae \nto reduce losses. \nI Encourage sustainable lending. We are working to \naddress the causes of the housing crisis and contribute\nto a healthier housing finance system. For example, we\nstrengthened lending standards, which helps ensure\nthat working Americans buy homes they can afford over\nthe long term. We offer long-term, fixed-rate mortgages\n— loans that protect homeowners from interest rate\nswings. We require better credit quality, documentation,\nand property appraisals. We offer tools for lenders to \nunderstand the quality of a loan before they sell it to\nFannie Mae — helping the lenders and Fannie Mae to \nreduce future risks.\nWe’re also committed to developing a better model \nfor servicing mortgages in a consistent and timely way.\nWhen the mortgage crisis hit, we turned to servicers to\nhelp hundreds of thousands of borrowers avoid losing\ntheir homes. But the existing servicing model provided\nlittle incentive for this different and greater responsibil-\nity. To address this problem, we introduced new \n2011 Outcomes\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n6\n2011 Outcomes\nstandards for mortgage servicers as part of a new \nservicing model required by our regulator, the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency (FHFA). The new model estab-\nlishes consistent policies and processes for servicing\ndelinquent loans owned or guaranteed by the GSEs,  \nand directs servicers to reach families earlier, communi-\ncate more frequently and clearly, and provide relief for\nfamilies. It is a major step toward creating a consistent\nand transparent process that enables homeowners to\nmake better-informed decisions.\nFrom improving loan quality to rethinking the servicing\nmodel, we are committed to creating long-term value for\nthe industry, customers, investors, and communities. \nI Support rental housing. Fannie Mae is the leading\nprovider of liquidity to the rental housing market. \nDemand for quality, affordable rental housing continues\nto grow. According to the Harvard Joint Center for \nHousing Studies, the number of households in America\nis expected to surge over the next decade — up to \n1 million new households per year.\nWe have made steady and measurable progress since\n2009, but still have important work ahead to continue to\nimprove the company’s financial performance, reduce risk,\nassist struggling homeowners, and help build a better\nhousing finance system.\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n7\nDespite the recent housing crisis, many Americans continue\nto have strong aspirations to own a home, according to \nFannie Mae's fourth-quarter 2011 National Housing Survey.\nWhile financial constraints and employment concerns may\nkeep potential homebuyers from acting in the near term, \nfuture improvements in these areas coupled with stabilizing\nhome prices may move Americans to pursue homeownership.\nFannie Mae enables new home sales and the refinancing \nof existing home loans by providing liquidity to the single-\nfamily market. \nPredictable, Sustainable Mortgage Options\nWe have strengthened underwriting and eligibility standards\nto support sustainable homeownership, enabling borrowers\nto have access to a variety of conforming mortgage prod-\nucts. This includes long-term, fixed-rate mortgages, such \nas the 15- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgage that protect\nhomeowners from interest rate swings.\nThe fixed-rate mortgage has been a staple of mortgage lend-\ning since the 1930s when it was created to help \nAmerica recover from the Great Depression. As of June \n2011, single-family fixed-rate mortgages constituted 86 \npercent of total mortgage debt outstanding. Fully amortizing\nfixed-rate mortgages made up 93 percent of the loans we\nguaranteed or purchased in 2011.\nAt Fannie Mae, we see the positive relationship between \nthe fixed-rate mortgage and sustainable homeownership.\nOur experience shows that borrowers more effectively main-\ntain homeownership when they have a loan with stable pay-\nments, combined with greater equity in the property and a\nhigher credit score. With a fixed-rate mortgage, homeowners\nknow exactly the amount and duration of their monthly prin-\ncipal and interest payment. We are committed to working\nwith our customers to ensure the best mortgage products\nare available — products that help homeowners, support \ntaxpayers, and strengthen America's housing \nmarket for the long term.\nCommitment to\nHomeownership\nWhat Lenders Say About Fannie Mae\n\"Our relationship with Fannie Mae is the true definition\nof 'partnership.' Over the years, no matter what the\nissue, Fannie Mae has always been there to support\nand guide us as our business grew.

Since 2009, we have \nimproved customer engagement to provide a more consis-\ntent experience while better understanding customer\nneeds and delivering solutions to meet those needs. \nI We have focused on helping our single-family cus-\ntomers deliver consistent, quality loans into the second-\nary market, which reduces loan repurchase risk in \nthe future. Using Fannie Mae's EarlyCheck™ feature,\nlenders can verify loan eligibility against Fannie Mae's\ndelivery guidelines earlier in their business process.\nAlso, in collaboration with FHFA, we helped implement\nstrong new industry standards for loan delivery and \nappraisal data through the Uniform Mortgage Data \nProgram® (UMDP®).\nI We established quality control standards such as those\ndetailed in our Beyond the Guide publication, which \noffers lenders insight on appropriate control points,\nfeedback cycles, and accountability that helps ensure\nloan quality is an essential aspect of loan origination.\nI We are helping homeowners facing different situations,\nfrom distressed or underwater borrowers to those \ncurrent on their mortgage. We do this by raising the level\nof service provided through programs such as the Home\nAffordable Modification Program (HAMP), Home Afford-\nable Refinance Program (HARP), the Servicing Alignment\nInitiative (SAI), and our Servicer Total Achievement and\nRewards™ (STAR)™ Performance Scorecard.\nFannie Mae's involvement in the market provides an outlet\nfor large and mid-sized lenders to make loans — whether\nthe borrower is refinancing or purchasing a home. Smaller\nlenders also play an important role. We have focused on\ntheir needs by streamlining and updating our lender \napproval process, increasing our focus on business devel-\nopment, and creating a dedicated customer engagement\nchannel to serve this segment of the market. We also \nprovide specific business solutions that help small lenders\nprovide liquidity to the housing market faster and more \nefficiently via our new whole loan e-Committing process,\nearly funding products, and Servicing Execution Tool\n(SET™) program offerings.\nThe customer engagement team works with lenders \nindividually and directly to help them deliver value to their\ncustomers. We offer a wide range of loan execution options,\ncomprehensive training through webinars and live forums,\nand customer management teams with expertise in capital\nmarkets, risk, servicing, and technology.\nFannie Mae's Loan Quality Focus:\nStrengthening the Market \nOne Loan at a Time\nFannie Mae's focus on improving loan quality is \ndesigned to assist the lender in collecting more accu-\nrate mortgage data early in the loan process. This helps\nto identify loans that don't meet Fannie Mae standards\nfor quality and eligibility before they are delivered to us. \nOur standards help all stakeholders in the mortgage\nprocess chain. By following our requirements, lenders\nhave the information they need to better manage risk.\nBorrowers have access to safer, more sustainable loans\nthat they can afford for the long term. We also provide\nongoing reporting tools, training, and feedback to\nlenders so they have the information they need to\noriginate loans that meet our delivery eligibility\nguidelines.\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n9\nWhile Fannie Mae works to support single-family mortgage\nlenders, we also remain committed to working with multi-\nfamily lenders to ensure the continued supply of affordable\nrental housing. Nearly 100 million American households \ncurrently pay rent and analysts expect renters to account\nfor 36 percent of U.S. households by 2015. For more than\n25 years, Fannie Mae’s multifamily mortgage business has\nsuccessfully and consistently provided a stable, reliable\nsecondary market for participants in the multifamily hous-\ning industry. We do this primarily through securitizing loans\nthat finance multifamily rental housing properties. \nRising demand and a diminishing new supply of rental \nhousing have produced strong multifamily fundamentals.\nWith job growth slowly improving and a lack of new apart-\nment supply coming online during the next 12 to 18 months,\nit is expected that rental demand will continue to outstrip\nsupply, producing lower vacancy levels and allowing for rent\ngrowth. As a result, the business outlook remains positive\nfor the multifamily sector.  \nFannie Mae played a critical role in 2011 and will continue to\ndo so by keeping capital flowing to the multifamily market,\nparticularly as other institutional sources have been slow \nto re-emerge since the financial downturn of 2008. As \nthe cornerstone of Fannie Mae's multifamily business, \nour unique Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS®)\nprogram incorporates sustainable credit standards, delega-\ntion of underwriting and servicing to a network of lenders,\nand risk-sharing of potential losses with those lenders over\nthe life of the loans. DUS has had a successful track record\nas reflected by its reputation in the marketplace among \nborrowers, lenders, and investors, and has outperformed\nother commercial mortgage-backed securities.\nCommitment to Affordable\nMultifamily Rental Housing\nWhat Lenders Say About Fannie Mae\n\"Fannie Mae has consistently provided needed \ncapital in the marketplace, which has allowed Walker &\nDunlop to finance high-quality apartment projects for\nworkforce rental housing. Through Fannie Mae's DUS\nprogram, we know our loans will be executed quickly\nand at market-competitive rates, which helps our\ncustomers. We also know that loans completed\nthrough DUS tend to perform better for the long term.\nWe're proud to be a DUS-approved lender and we look\nforward to our continued partnership with Fannie Mae.\"\n— William Walker, Chairman, President, and CEO, \nWalker & Dunlop\nEstimated National Rental Level and Vacancy Rates\nSource: Fannie Mae Multifamily Economics and Market Research * Preliminary estimate\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n10\nCommitment to Affordable Multifamily Rental Housing\nAddressing the Need \nfor Workforce Rental Housing\nWhile a strong business outlook can benefit those who own or\ninvest in multifamily properties, we understand that finding \naffordable rental housing is an issue for many Americans.\nThrough the secondary mortgage market we support rental\nhousing for the workforce, senior citizens, students, members\nof the military, and families with significant economic need. \nMultifamily rental housing accounts for a significant portion\nof all affordable housing available today. There are three \nprimary segments of the multifamily market: Public Housing,\nSubsidized, and Conventional Market Rate Housing. Fannie\nMae supports the affordable multifamily market by financing\nboth conventional market rate rental properties and govern-\nment-subsidized rental properties that are privately owned.\nI As the demand for quality, affordable rental housing \nincreased in 2011, Fannie Mae and our lender partners\nprovided more than $24 billion in debt financing for 2,763\nmortgage loans. Approximately 98 percent ($23.8 billion)\nof the debt that Fannie Mae financed in 2011 was deliv-\nered through the MBS execution. \nI Fannie Mae has targeted the middle of the rental market.\nEighty-nine percent of the nearly 423,000 multifamily\nunits we financed in 2011 were affordable to families \nearning at or below the median income in their area.\nSpecifically, more than 301,000 housing units were af-\nfordable to families with incomes no higher than 80 \npercent of the area media income. More than 84,000\nunits were affordable to families at or below 50 percent \nof the area median income.\n$1,060\n$1,040\n$1,020\n$1,000\n$980\n$960\n$940\n$920\n$900\n8%\n8%\n7%\n6%\n5%\n4%\n3%\n2%\n1%\n0%\n2005Q3\n2005Q4\n2006Q1\n2006Q2\n2006Q3\n2006Q4\n2007Q1\n2007Q2\n2007Q3\n2007Q4\n2008Q1\n2008Q2\n2008Q3\n2008Q4\n2009Q1\n2009Q2\n2009Q3\n2009Q4\n2010Q1\n2010Q2\n2010Q3\n2010Q4\n2011Q1\n2011Q2\n2011Q3\n2011Q4p*\nI Rental Level I Vacancy Rate\n$1,045 (2011Q4p*) 6.25% (2011Q4p*)\nGreen Program Supports Developers,\nOwners, and Renters\nIn June of 2011, the U.S. Department of Housing and\nUrban Development (HUD) and Fannie Mae launched\nGreen Preservation Plus, a product enhancement to\nFannie Mae’s existing risk sharing program. The\nprogram provides additional financing to affordable\nhousing owners and developers to invest in property\nimprovements and in energy- and water-efficiency\nmeasures at the time of refinance of an existing loan or\nacquisition of a new property.\nGreen Preservation Plus supports our ongoing commit-\nment to creating a more sustainable rental housing\nmarket that is affordable to low- and moderate-income\nfamilies. The program provides more renters with \nrenovated apartments in which to live, allows building\nowners to better manage their energy costs, and helps\ncommunities by reducing the environmental footprint\nof rental properties.\nThe program gained positive traction in 2011, and we are\nin the process of broadening its scope to offer enhance-\nments that help more borrowers and owners in 2012.\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n11\nCommitment to Affordable Multifamily Rental Housing\nPromoting Environmental Sustainability\nand Affordability for Multifamily Housing\nThe nation’s inventory of affordable multifamily housing is\naging. Half of all multifamily properties are over 30 years old\nand more than 10 percent were built before 1940. As the\nmultifamily housing stock continues to age, small to signifi-\ncant investments are required to preserve the quality of\naging properties and, importantly, to keep them affordable\nfor owners to operate and tenants to rent. At the same time,\nproperty owners and tenants alike are facing rising utility\nrates, resulting in higher costs to heat, cool, and provide\nwater to common areas and units. \nIn 2010, Fannie Mae launched the Multifamily Green Initia-\ntive to integrate the benefits of energy- and water-efficiency\nmeasures into multifamily properties and financing prod-\nucts and processes. We help owners identify opportunities\nto save on energy and water costs while improving housing\nquality and extending the useful life of affordable and work-\nforce housing properties.\nIn a joint effort with the Urban Land Institute, the National\nMulti Housing Council, and the Commercial Real Estate\nCouncil®, Fannie Mae began a market research project in\n2011 to gather and analyze energy and water usage and \ncost information from multifamily rental properties across\nthe United States. We expect this research will be of value to\napartment managers and owners of apartment complexes,\nas well as tenants. The data are expected to be released in\n2012 and will be shared with the U.S. Environmental Protec-\ntion Agency as it explores the development of an ENERGY\nSTAR energy performance rating system for multifamily\nproperties. This rating already exists for many other property\ntypes, including offices and schools.\nConverting Foreclosures into Afford-\nable Multifamily Rentals\nAs rental demand increases, the number of housing\nunits that minimum wage households can afford has\nfallen, declining by nearly 16 percent from 1997 to\n2007, according to the 2010 State of the Nation’s\nHousing Report, published by the Harvard Joint \nCenter for Housing Studies. Older, lower-rent build-\nings are being demolished or abandoned, or they \nare converted into higher-end rentals or condos.\nUnfortunately, the production of new affordable\nrentals is not keeping pace with the loss of older\nunits. This is an increasingly critical challenge at a\ntime when more individuals and families need a safe,\naffordable place to live. \nIn 2011, we marketed multifamily real estate owned\n(REO) properties to non-profits and public entities\nwho would reinvest in the properties and preserve\nthem as affordable rental housing. In one example,\nUMOM New Day Centers acquired a Fannie Mae \nmultifamily REO property with plans to redevelop it \nas permanently affordable and supportive housing.\nUMOM is a non-profit housing and social services\nprovider for homeless families and individuals in\nPhoenix, AZ. UMOM sought to redevelop North Moun-\ntain Lodge — a Fannie Mae foreclosed property — to\ncreate affordable, supportive housing for the families\non their waiting lists.\nFannie Mae foreclosed on North Mountain Lodge\nApartments in May of 2011. At the same time, Fannie\nMae was working with the Corporation for Supportive\nHousing (CSH), a national non-profit committed to\nhelping communities create permanent housing \nservices to prevent and end homelessness. With a\npredevelopment and acquisition loan from CSH,\nUMOM had the financing available to make a competi-\ntive offer on the apartment complex. UMOM acquired\nNorth Mountain Lodge in November of 2011.\nUMOM will now use the North Mountain Lodge site to\ncreate 48 units of permanently affordable, supportive\nhousing for chronically homeless people, low-income\nfamilies, and returning veterans and their families\nwho are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Social\nservices will be provided for the tenants including\nafter-school programs, job development services,\nsubstance abuse counseling, medical outreach, \nbehavioral health support, and community recreation. \nBy the Numbers\nWe are a primary source of financing across the \nspectrum of the multifamily housing market. In 2011, \nFannie Mae enabled:\nI\n$2.3 billion in rent-restricted housing\nI\n$2.4 billion in small loans (loans up to $3 million, \nor $5 million in high-cost areas)\nI\n$6.9 billion in large loans (loans $25 million or higher)\nI\n$2 billion in structured transactions\nI\n$1.4 billion in seniors housing\nI\n$535 million in manufactured housing\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n12\nCommitment to Affordable Multifamily Rental Housing\nManufactured Housing Communities\nManufactured housing provides affordable homes for \nmany low- and moderate-income borrowers, especially in\nhigh-cost and rural areas. In fact, nearly 7 percent of the \nnation's occupied housing units are manufactured homes.\nFannie Mae supports manufactured housing to expand \naffordable homeownership by providing liquidity to this\ngrowing market segment. Through our multifamily mortgage\nbusiness, we offer financing options through lender part-\nners for residential real estate developments where \nthe borrower owns the manufactured housing community\n(MHC) sites and manages associated common amenities\nand infrastructure. Here, individual tenants can lease a \nlot in the community and connect their home to utility serv-\nices, providing them with an affordable place to live.\nAgency financing for MHCs exists only through Fannie Mae's\nnationwide network of approved lenders. We provide low-\ncost capital and a steady source of funding to lenders active\nin the manufactured housing sector through standardized\nunderwriting, valuation, and documentation processes. Our\nMHC business has grown substantially and typically serves\nan older and lower area median income population. \nUsing Fannie Mae's products, Grandbridge Real Estate Capital LLC financed\nAzalea Gardens, a manufactured housing community near Tacoma, WA.\nFannie Mae Financing Provides \nOptions for Seniors\nIn 2011, Fannie Mae helped refinance a maturing loan for\na 68-unit assisted living and Alzheimer's care facility \nin Erie, PA. The borrower on the loan is a local, privately\nowned company that develops and operates its proper-\nties within the northern Great Lakes markets. By refi-\nnancing the loan, the borrower received immediate\ncash-out proceeds to use in the development of a new\nseniors housing property. The structure of the 10-year\nfixed-rate loan also enabled the borrower to lock in low-\ncost, long-term financing so that affordable rents for\ncurrent and future residents could be maintained.\nSeniors Housing: An In-Demand Industry\nThe segment of the U.S. population aged 65 and older, \nrepresenting nearly 40 million people, is expected to \nincrease over the next few decades in large part due to \nthe aging of the baby boomer generation, who are reaching\ntheir mid-60’s and living longer, healthier lives. Many \nAmericans within this growing segment live in single-family\nhomes. Others are choosing seniors rental housing, which\nmay include independent living, assisted living, or\nAlzheimer's care facilities.\nFinancing for the seniors housing sector is highly special-\nized and combines aspects of traditional rental housing\nwith the business of seniors’ care. As with our conventional\nmultifamily customers, today’s seniors housing borrowers\nrequire flexibility, certainty of execution, and competitive\npricing. Fannie Mae’s seniors housing team partners with \na targeted group of lenders through our DUS platform to\nprovide customized financing solutions that meet the\nunique needs of the seniors housing industry.\nProviding quality housing for America’s aging population is\nimportant and Fannie Mae continues to serve this market by\noffering various financing options. In 2011, we provided $1.4\nbillion in senior debt financing to non-profit organizations\nand other borrowers, including private equity investors, \npublicly traded operators, and private and public real estate\ninvestment trusts, which helped produce and/or preserve\nnearly 12,000 seniors rental units across 151 U.S. cities \nand towns.\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n13\nFannie Mae’s capital markets group supports the single-\nfamily and multifamily businesses by providing lender \ncustomers various avenues to sell the mortgages they \noriginate. This enables customers to replenish their funds,\nmake more loans, and hedge their risks in a cost-efficient\nmanner. \nThe capital markets group also promotes general liquidity in\nthe mortgage market. As America’s largest single issuer of\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS), Fannie Mae has helped\ncreate a reliable securitization market that supports the \nrecovery and growth of U.S. housing. To achieve our business\nobjectives, we must excel in evaluating, pricing, and manag-\ning credit risk and deliver superior MBS and fixed-income\nproducts to the capital markets.\nWith dedicated teams in both the single-family and multi-\nfamily capital markets space, we provide a diverse line of\nproduct offerings and transaction alternatives aimed at\nmeeting investor needs. Fannie Mae's current business \nactivity is focused on making short-term use of our balance\nsheet, rather than long-term investments. To do so, the \ncapital markets team works with lender customers to \nprovide funds to the mortgage market through short-term\nfinancing and investing activities, including but not limited\nto the following:\nI The Whole Loan Conduit — Whole Loan Conduit activi-\nties involve our purchase of loans principally for the \npurpose of securitizing them. We purchase loans from \na large group of lenders and securitize them as Fannie\nMae MBS, which may then be sold to dealers and \ninvestors. In 2011, Whole Loan Conduit volumes totaled\n$85 billion. \nI Early Funding — Through our Early Funding products,\nwe can purchase whole loans or pools of loans on an \naccelerated basis. This allows lenders to replenish their\nfunds faster and to continue originating new loans. \nPrograms like Early Funding have proven to be a critical\nsource of liquidity during challenging economic times. \nIn 2011, early funding volumes totaled $111 billion and\nhave exceeded $319 billion since 2009.\nI REMICs and Other Structured Securitizations — We\nissue structured Fannie Mae MBS (including REMICs,\nSMBS, and Megas), typically for lender customers or \nsecurities dealer customers, in exchange for a transac-\ntion fee. In 2011, structured transactions volumes \ntotaled $770 billion.\nI MBS Trading — We regularly enter into purchase and\nsale transactions with other market participants involv-\ning mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae,\nFreddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, which we refer to as\n\"agency MBS.\" These transactions can provide for the\nfuture delivery of MBS with underlying loans that share\ncertain general characteristics (often referred to as the\n\"TBA market\"), or specifically identified MBS with loans\nhaving other characteristics that some investors seek\n(often referred to as the \"Specified Pools market\").\nThrough our trading activity in the TBA and Specified\nPools markets, we provide significant liquidity to the\nagency MBS markets. In 2011, these MBS trading \nvolumes totaled $112 billion.\nThrough our capital markets activities, Fannie Mae con-\ntributes to a stronger housing finance industry by providing\nimmediate liquidity to the market and by helping lenders\nconduct their business more efficiently.\nOur Role in \nCapital Markets\nFannie Mae GeMS™\nWhen the U.S. economy began to contract in 2007, many\nfinancial institutions exited the multifamily financing \nmarket. Fannie Mae stayed in the game and raised our\nstake, keeping credit flowing as more families sought \naffordable workforce rental housing. Today, we are the\nmarket leader in financing U.S. multifamily mortgages. \nAnd, Fannie Mae's suite of multifamily MBS products are\nhelping provide a continuous source of stable funding to\nsupport the nation’s rental housing market. Our GeMS™\nexecutions are a big part of this success.\nFannie Mae GeMS are Guaranteed Multifamily Structures.\nIntroduced in late 2011, they provide a platform for design-\ning structured securities from the multifamily MBS in \nour portfolio. GeMS help us reduce balance sheet usage\nand operate more efficiently, and we tailor them to meet \ninvestors’ specific needs based on market conditions.\nWe took the first step toward GeMS in 2009 when we\nstarted to shift production in the multifamily business\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n14\nfrom whole loans we bought and held in the portfolio \ntoward a more market-driven, MBS-style execution that\nresulted in securities we could sell to others. Through this\nshift, we have been able to provide competitive, transpar-\nent, auction-style pricing that allows outside investors \ndirect access to our multifamily product. Having an MBS\nexecution means that there are more dealers willing to\ncommit their resources — including traders, sales, \nbalance sheet, analytics, and research — which leads \nto a more liquid multifamily market.\nToday, through GeMS and other initiatives, Fannie Mae's\nmultifamily MBS outstanding has grown to over $100 \nbillion. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we issued $7.2 billion\nmultifamily MBS, the highest quarterly issuance since\nFannie Mae began reinvigorating our multifamily MBS\nbusiness in 2009. Our total new multifamily issuance for\nlast year was $23.8 billion, up from $16.4 billion in 2010.\nThis includes $6 billion of DUS MBS resecuritized through\nthe GeMS program, a significant milestone for the pro-\ngram’s first year.\nOur Role in Capital Markets\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n15\nAt Fannie Mae, we work with a variety of industry partners to\nmeet the needs of America’s homeowners and strengthen\nthe housing system for the future. Whether supporting a\nspecialized lender or an organization fighting mortgage\nfraud, Fannie Mae is a dedicated partner to those who work\nthroughout the housing industry. \nState Housing Finance Agencies\nState Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) use Fannie Mae\nproducts and pricing to expand homeownership and rental\npossibilities for families earning at or below the area median\nincome. They also focus their business on first-time home-\nbuyers. We provide critical financing to HFAs by purchasing\nhigh-performing loans at preferred rates and terms.\nThrough our alliance with the National Council of State\nHousing Agencies (NCSHA), we help HFAs meet the afford-\nable housing needs of the communities they serve. We do\nthis by granting participating members access to a suite of\ndistinct Fannie Mae mortgage lending options designed to\nhelp them bridge the affordable housing gap in their state.\nCredit Unions\nFannie Mae's continued support for credit unions remains\nstrong throughout the economic recovery. As community-\nbased trusted advisors, credit unions exist to meet their\nmembers’ lifetime financial needs for affordable credit. We\npurchase their loans to free up capital so they can issue\nmore loans to families who rely on credit unions for their\nspecific banking needs. Through an alliance with the \nNational Association of Federal Credit Unions (NAFCU) and\nthe Credit Union National Association (CUNA), we're able to\nhelp credit unions expand the appeal of the mortgage prod-\nucts and services they currently offer their membership.\nProgress Through \nPartnership\nSupporting State Housing \nFinance Agencies\nWhile the housing market remains challenging, state\nHFAs continue to make homeownership affordable and\nsustainable for working families. Over the years, HFAs\nhave helped millions of families purchase a home or\nobtain rental housing.\nWhile the agencies often work with borrowers who are\nnew to homeownership, HFAs have a solid record of\nsuccessful, sustainable lending. Their formula includes\neducation and counseling that prepares borrowers for\nthe responsibilities of homeownership and mortgage\ndebt, as well as providing high-quality mortgage\nproducts with low fixed rates, fully documented,\nprudent underwriting, and proactive servicing.\nAs a result, delinquency and foreclosure rates of HFA\nloans are well below those of the conventional market,\naccording to the NCSHA.\nFannie Mae has provided reliable liquidity for HFA\nlending, including support for local HFAs. In 2011,\nFannie Mae acquired nearly 3,500 HFA-originated\nloans totaling $518 million. We also launched a new set\nof offerings to NCSHA members that simplify pricing\nstructures and improve underwriting capabilities in\nexchange for high-performing, fixed-rate mortgages.\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n16\nCommunity Organizations\nThrough partnerships at the community level, Fannie Mae is\nable to meet the needs of families in a far more direct and \nimpactful way. We work with established organizations in\ncommunities across the country to prevent foreclosure, \nrevitalize neighborhoods, address homelessness, and much\nmore. For example, in 2011 we partnered with HomeFree-USA,\nlocal community and elected officials, and area mortgage\nservicers to open a Mortgage Help Center in Prince George's\nCounty, MD, to help struggling homeowners in the Washing-\nton, DC area. (Read more about Fannie Mae Mortgage Help\nCenters on page 19 of this report.) Also, as a result of our\nlong-standing partnership with Habitat for Humanity, Fannie\nMae employee volunteers built and refurbished homes and\nproperties in particularly hard-hit communities.\nPublic Entities Using Neighborhood \nStabilization Program Funds\nWe work closely with public entities through the Neighbor-\nhood Stabilization Program (NSP), established by HUD.\nNearly $7 billion was allocated to state and local govern-\nments for the purpose of stabilizing communities that \nhave suffered from foreclosures and abandonment. To \nassist these public entity partners with their neighborhood\nstabilization strategies, Fannie Mae created the First Look™ \nprogram that allows a public entity, non-profit, or owner-\noccupant buyer the exclusive opportunity to purchase \nFannie Mae properties before an investor during the first \n15 days of property listing. (Learn more about First Look on\npage 21 of this report.)\nWe also created a pool sale program that allows public \nentities to purchase pools of properties that are strategic \nto their stabilization strategies. As of December 2011, over\n9,500 Fannie Mae properties have been purchased by public\nentities, non-profits, and owner occupants using NSP and\nother public funds, with sales totaling over $850 million.\nBuilding a Difference in Atlanta\nIn March 2011, a team of Atlanta employees and their\nfamily members and friends participated in a volunteer\nevent to help make homeownership a reality for one\nfamily. \nThe group joined Atlanta Habitat for Humanity for a day\nof hammering, dry-walling, painting, and more as part of\na house build to benefit a married couple and their five\nchildren. The homebuyers had to qualify to purchase the\nhome by meeting Habitat for Humanity's standards.\nFor more than 20 years, our employees have partici-\npated in Atlanta Habitat for Humanity home builds \nsponsored by Fannie Mae. “Fannie Mae’s long-standing\npartnership with Atlanta Habitat for Humanity has been\na great way for employees to get involved and make a\ndifference in the community in a very hands-on way,”\nsaid Mac Smith, a customer account risk manager and\nevent coordinator in Fannie Mae's eastern region. “We\nare very proud to be part of these efforts.”\nFannie Mae employees participate in a home build project with \nHabitat for Humanity.\nProgress Through Partnership\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n17\nProgress Through Partnership\nLand Banks\nFannie Mae works collaboratively with local land banks to\nsupport the acquisition and stabilization strategies of the\nlocal community. Cities, counties, and states across the\ncountry have created land banks to address the increase in\nvacant and abandoned properties within their boundaries.\nTypically, land banks enable local governments to acquire\nneglected, vacant parcels of land or properties, and rede-\nvelop them to help transform struggling neighborhoods into\nhealthier, safer communities. These projects often result in\nnew affordable housing, commercial facilities, and even\ngreen spaces and parkland.\nNational and Local Law Enforcement \nMortgage fraud remains a large and growing problem in \nthe United States, especially because many struggling\nhomeowners are targeted by foreclosure prevention\nscams. Fannie Mae works with partners to help prevent \nand stop mortgage fraud, whether it's perpetrated by a \nborrower, a lender, or another person or institution.\nWe collaborate closely with national and local law enforce-\nment by providing detailed, real-time information about\nmortgage and financial frauds to assist in their investiga-\ntions and prosecution. Fannie Mae employees also fre-\nquently attend and speak at mortgage fraud training\nevents designed to familiarize law enforcement with the\ntrends that we encounter.\nPartnering with Detroit Land \nBank Authority\nIn 2011, Fannie Mae worked closely with the Detroit\nLand Bank Authority (DLBA) to identify Fannie Mae\nREO properties that would support their mission to \nrestore six historic neighborhoods to their original\ncondition. Using First Look™, the DLBA acquired 55\nFannie Mae REO properties before they were pur-\nchased by investors. The homes were renovated with\nhistoric and energy-efficient improvements and resold\nto owner occupants who also received homebuyer \neducation training. Through these efforts, DLBA and\nFannie Mae helped to restore vibrant neighborhoods\nand create affordable, sustainable homeownership.\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n18\nA loan refinance allows the homeowner to take advantage \nof today’s historically low interest rates.\nI Through our Refi PlusTM initiative, which provides expanded\nrefinance opportunities for eligible Fannie Mae borrowers,\nwe acquired more than 730,000 loans in 2011, for a total of\napproximately 1.7 million loans since 2009. \nI About 29 percent of these refinances have been \ncompleted through MHA's Home Affordable Refinance\nProgram (HARP) — the refinance program available to\nborrowers who have stayed current on their mortgage, \nincluding those who have a mortgage with a higher loan-\nto-value ratio as well as “underwater” borrowers who owe\nmore on their loan than the value of their home.\nIn situations where a homeowner has an unsustainable mort-\ngage and homeownership is no longer viable, Fannie Mae \noffers alternatives to foreclosure. These alternatives can \nenable homeowners to start repairing their credit sooner\nthan if they go through foreclosure, and some may be able \nto get a Fannie Mae mortgage to purchase a home in as little\nas two years.\nI Since January 2009, Fannie Mae has completed more\nthan 195,000 short sales and DIL, including over 79,000\nin 2011.\nFrom 2009 through 2011, Fannie Mae helped almost 1 million\nhomeowners retain their homes or otherwise avoid foreclo-\nsure. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we completed more\nthan 82,000 single-family loan workouts, including more\nthan 60,000 home retention solutions (modifications, \nrepayment plans, and forbearances). \nIn 2011, many homeowners struggled to avoid foreclosure.\nFannie Mae is strongly committed to helping distressed\nhomeowners stay in their homes whenever possible. Our \nefforts focus on encouraging borrowers to work with their\nservicers to find the best solution to meet their needs. We\ncompleted more than 328,000 single-family loan workouts \nin 2011.\nSometimes foreclosure cannot be avoided. In these situa-\ntions, Fannie Mae works to help borrowers exit their home\ngracefully, through options such as a short sale or deed-in-\nlieu (DIL) of foreclosure. Our REO sales team works on selling\nFannie Mae foreclosed properties for the highest price possi-\nble to stabilize communities and minimize taxpayer losses. \nPreventing Foreclosures and \nPromoting Sustainable Solutions\nFannie Mae uses an array of tools to help distressed home-\nowners understand their options, get help, and find the \nbest solution.\nMost of Fannie Mae's home retention solutions are loan mod-\nifications. A loan modification enables the homeowner \nto achieve a more affordable monthly payment, which helps\nthem sustain payments on the modified loan and remain in\ntheir home.\nI We completed more than 213,000 loan modifications in\n2011, for a total of more than 715,000 since January 2009. \nI Homeowners in loan modifications save a median of \n$352 per month in principal and interest payments, or \n31 percent of the median before-modification payment.\nI About 52 percent of Fannie Mae’s modifications to help\nhomeowners in 2011 were completed under HAMP. HAMP\nis a part of Making Home Affordable (MHA) — a program\ncreated in 2009 by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\n(Treasury) and HUD to help struggling homeowners.\nHelping Homeowners \nand Stabilizing \nHard-Hit Communities\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n19\nAdministrating the MHA Program\nIn addition to being a participant in MHA, Fannie Mae is the\nMHA program administrator in support of the U.S. Depart-\nment of the Treasury. In this role, Fannie Mae implements\nguidelines and policies for the program, develops and \nmaintains the MHA technology system of record, facilitates\nprogram incentive payments, manages MHA servicer rela-\ntionships, provides training, and develops and coordinates\nborrower outreach events. Since its launch in 2009, MHA has\nhelped struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure through\nprograms designed to modify first and second liens, provide\nunemployment forbearance, and facilitate short sales and\ndeeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. \nMHA has helped establish industry standards and practices\nfor affordable modifications, homeowner protections, and\noutreach. In 2011, Fannie Mae continued to support Treasury\nand HUD's efforts to make the benefits of HAMP and HARP\navailable to American homeowners: \nIn 2011, Fannie Mae continued to support the Treasury's \nefforts to make the benefits of HAMP and HARP available \nto American homeowners:\nI As of the end of 2011, HAMP enabled over 930,000\nhomeowners to receive permanent modifications of\ntheir mortgages.\nI In November 2011, we helped launch HARP 2.0 to enable\nmore borrowers take advantage of MHA benefits. \nProviding Direct Mortgage Assistance \nin Hard-Hit Communities\nWe provide free education and one-on-one support for \ndistressed homeowners through a network of new Fannie \nMae Mortgage Help Centers. In cooperation with HUD-certi-\nfied non-profit agencies, homeowners can speak directly with \non-site English- and Spanish-speaking staff and experienced\nhousing counselors to discuss their mortgage situation and\nthe foreclosure prevention options available to them. In addi-\ntion to providing counseling and access to mortgage educa-\ntion and financial literacy resources, the centers assist\nhomeowners by coordinating with their mortgage servicers\nto help ensure a timely resolution.\nWe manage centers in 12 of America’s hardest-hit housing\nmarkets: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Jacksonville, Los Angeles\n(Culver City), Miami, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Sacramento, \nSt. Louis (Clayton, MO), Tampa, and Washington, DC (Green-\nbelt, MD). Each facility supports the metropolitan area\nwhere it is located as well as borrowers from across the\nstate. These centers helped borrowers obtain nearly 6,100\nhome retention plans in 2011.\nIn addition to the Mortgage Help Center facilities, Fannie\nMae has established partnerships with counseling agen-\ncies in 16 markets across the country, referred to as \nthe Mortgage Help Network, to allow more Fannie Mae \ncustomers access to existing housing counselor facilities.\nLike the Mortgage Help Centers, these customer outreach\nchannels provide face-to-face, free, and expedited assis-\ntance to struggling borrowers.\nThrough our expanded partnership with the HOPE Hotline\n(888-995-HOPE) — which offers free, comprehensive, \nand around-the-clock foreclosure assistance and housing\ncounseling services — Fannie Mae borrowers anywhere \nin the country can now be connected to the Mortgage Help\nNetwork or a Mortgage Help Center. Fannie Mae also pro-\nvides counseling through partnerships with qualified credit\nand debt advisory organizations through a current pilot \nprogram for borrowers who have already received a loan \nmodification.\nTotal Single-Family Loan Workouts \nPer Month in 2011\n50,000\n40,000\n30,000\n20,000\n10,000\n0\nI Total Workouts\nJan-11\nFeb-11\nMar-11\nApr-11\nMay-11\nJun-11\nJul-11\nAug-11\nSep-11\nOct-11\nNov-11\nDec-11\nHelping Homeowners and Stabilizing Hard-Hit Communities\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n20\nHelping Homeowners and Stabilizing Hard-Hit Communities\nLeveraging Technology Solutions\nWe have created innovative online tools, with a focus on \nusability and efficiency, and aligned Fannie Mae's external-\nfacing websites and resources with those of our partners, \nto help consumers access the information they need more\neasily and quickly.\nI KnowYourOptions.com is a bilingual consumer education\nwebsite that outlines the options that may be available to\nhomeowners who are looking to refinance or struggling\nwith their mortgage. Since its debut in August 2010, the\nwebsite has logged nearly 700,000 visits (more than\n530,000 in 2011 alone) and averages more than 40,000\nvisits per month. More than eight in 10 visitors are new \nto the site, which indicates that a consistent stream of \npeople are learning about the resource and getting the \ninformation they need to enable them to take action.   \nI KnowYourOptions.com also features WaysHome™, \na unique and innovative educational video launched \nin early 2011. The interactive simulation allows home-\nowners to participate in real-life scenarios, make \nhypothetical choices, learn the consequences of those\nchoices, and identify the best options for retaining or \nexiting their homes. In 2011, users launched the video\nand navigated through the simulation nearly 22,000\ntimes. Launch the video simulation\nI HomePath.com lists Fannie Mae-owned properties for\nsale and provides information about special financing\noptions available only on our properties. The website\nmakes it easy for all potential buyers to search thou-\nsands of move-in ready foreclosed properties — \nincluding single-family homes, town houses, and \ncondominiums — learn about mortgage financing, \naccess handy tools and resources, and get help with \nthe buying process.\nIn August 2009, the first month after HomePath.com\nlaunched, the site logged more than 400,000 visits. \nIn 2011, it averaged more than 2.2 million visits per\nmonth, roughly one-third of which were unique visits.\nOverall, the website has logged over 45 million visits\nsince its debut, and more than 27 million in 2011 alone.\nWhat Borrowers Say About \nFannie Mae Mortgage Help Centers\nIn 2011, Fannie Mae opened a Mortgage Help Center \nin St. Louis, MO, and provided assistance to borrower\nPete Farley, helping his family avoid foreclosure and\nkeep their home.\n“My daughter and I had applied for a loan modification\non her home, as we were having a difficult time making\nthe monthly mortgage payments. We had been turned\ndown three times before learning about a new Fannie\nMae Mortgage Help Center in our area. We were their\nfirst customer! \nOur Fannie Mae housing counselor and documentation\nreview specialist took us through the application\nprocess with ease. Their knowledge, guidance, and\nprofessionalism was a welcomed change from what\nwe had experienced before, and we were elated to hear\nthat our application was quickly approved. I truly be-\nlieve had it not been for their due diligence, persistent\nfollow-up, and advocating on our behalf, we would have\nbeen turned down again and may have lost our home.\nOur Fannie Mae team uncomplicated what was an ex-\ntremely long and frustrating process and brought it to\na quick and positive resolution. They far exceeded our\nexpectations.”\n— Pete Farley, St. Louis, MO\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n21\nHelping Homeowners and Stabilizing Hard-Hit Communities\nImproving Mortgage Servicing Standards\nIn an effort to establish greater consistency in the servicing\nof delinquent loans, Fannie Mae has implemented \nnew delinquency management and default prevention\nstandards, requiring mortgage servicers to use a uniform\napproach, consistent guidelines, and clear timelines when\nworking with delinquent borrowers. Through the FHFA-\nmandated Servicing Alignment Initiative (SAI), the GSEs\nhave aligned their servicing requirements for borrower \ncontact, delinquency management practices, loan modifi-\ncations, and foreclosure timelines. This approach will \nallow servicers to streamline and simplify their processes,\nresulting in:\nI Improved service to borrowers as well as greater \nconsistency and clarity in borrower communications.\nI More efficient processing of loan modifications.\nI Consistency, fairness, and efficiency in the foreclosure\nprocess.\nI Increased servicer accountability, reinforced by new \nincentives and compensatory fees.\nThese new servicing standards aim to achieve faster resolu-\ntion and lessen borrower frustration, with the ultimate goal \nof keeping people in their homes whenever possible and \nminimizing financial losses to Fannie Mae and to taxpayers.\nIn accordance with SAI, Fannie Mae launched a new effort \ndesigned to measure and evaluate servicers’ performance \nas a way to further promote transparency, accountability, \nand excellence in mortgage servicing, while recognizing \nand incentivizing those who consistently deliver strong, \ncustomer-driven results.\nThe Servicer Total Achievement and Rewards (STAR) \nProgram is a comprehensive performance management\nsystem. It provides clear expectations and specific, consis-\ntent measurements to help Fannie Mae servicers increase\ntheir focus on improving customer satisfaction and overall\nhousing outcomes. The program directly links service \nperformance to homeowners whom the servicer has helped\nas well as the customer’s overall experience with their ser-\nvicer. A key component of the STAR Program is the Servicer\nPerformance Scorecard, which provides monthly perform-\nance indicators to help servicers effectively assess their\nprogress.\nThe STAR Program is designed to:\nI Provide consistent, specific, and measurable \nexpectations for Fannie Mae servicers.\nI Align servicer activities to Fannie Mae's business goals.\nI Focus on success drivers to help prioritize efforts.\nI Gauge and communicate relative performance.\nI Standardize data feeds to promote future analytic \ncapabilities.\nI Provide financial incentive and opportunities for \nrecognition of top performers.\nPutting Fannie Mae Properties \nBack on the Market\nWhen all other options are exhausted and foreclosure is the\nend result, Fannie Mae works to sell foreclosed properties\nfor the highest price possible and to buyers who will make\nthe properties their homes. We seek to keep properties in\ngood condition and, in some cases, conduct repairs to make\nthem more marketable. This provides quality, affordable\nhousing options to new homebuyers and also helps to stabi-\nlize neighborhoods and home values.\nForeclosed homes become part of Fannie Mae’s real estate\nowned (REO) inventory. In 2011, we completed repairs \nto approximately 89,800 properties sold from our single-\nfamily REO inventory. Overall, we sold nearly 244,000 \nFannie Mae single-family REO properties in 2011, approxi-\nmately 44,000 more than we added to our inventory during\nthe year. Roughly 60 percent of these properties were sold\nto individuals, non-profit organizations, or public entities\nversus investors.\nIn particular, through our First Look™program we give \npotential homebuyers the opportunity to make an offer on\nour REO properties before investors. Fannie Mae under-\nstands that owner occupants are vital to neighborhoods\nand communities. Owner occupants tend to work, go to\nschool, and shop in their neighborhoods. They are also\nmore likely to make improvements to their residences and\ncontribute to their communities’ livability. The First Look\nperiod is typically the first 15 days a property is listed on\nHomePath.com, during which eligible buyers can apply to\npurchase the home before facing investor competition.\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n22\nHelping Homeowners and Stabilizing Hard-Hit Communities\nREOs Provide Homes \nfor First-time Homebuyers\nThe GA Dream Homeownership Program — provided\nthrough the Georgia Department of Community Affairs\n(DCA), the state’s lead agency in housing finance and\ndevelopment — is available to first-time homebuyers\nand those who purchase a home in targeted areas. \nGA Dream makes purchasing a home more affordable\nfor low- to moderate-income families and provides \nfree homebuyer education. Applicants seeking down\npayment and closing cost assistance are required to\ncomplete a homebuyer education class prior to closing. \nSharing a mission to promote homeownership, in late\n2010 Fannie Mae and DCA collaborated to create a\nstreamlined process for GA Dream homebuyers to \npurchase a Fannie Mae-owned home. This collaboration\nfacilitated more REO purchases by GA Dream homebuy-\ners and further strengthened our relationship with the\nGeorgia DCA. \nIn 2011 Fannie Mae sold 230 REO properties to owner\noccupants using the GA Dream Homeownership Pro-\ngram. This program not only helps fulfill the dream of\nhomeownership to first-time homeowners, but also\nprovides homebuyers the opportunity to learn more\nabout the process of purchasing a home and the \nresponsibilities of homeownership, while promoting \naffordable housing, community development, and\nneighborhood stabilization. \nStabilizing Communities \nThrough REO Sales\nChicanos Por La Causa (CPLC) is a leading non-profit\norganization in the areas of economic development,\ncommunity development, education, and social serv-\nices. It is the largest community development corpora-\ntion in Arizona with a mission “to build stronger,\nhealthier communities.”\nIn 2009, CPLC led a national collaborative in an appli-\ncation for Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) 2\nfunds. Along with partners in 15 different markets, \nin early 2010 they were awarded $137 million — the\nsecond-largest NSP 2 allocation in the nation. With\nthis funding, they sought to acquire, rehabilitate, and\nresell single-family REO assets; acquire, redevelop,\nand manage multifamily REO assets; and acquire \nand demolish severely blighted homes to establish \na land bank.\nIn 2011 alone, CPLC and the consortium purchased 95\nsingle-family REO properties from Fannie Mae, making\nthem one of the largest non-profit REO purchasers of\n2011. Though based in Arizona, this collaborative is\nbuilding stronger, healthier communities across the\nUnited States. The homes are actively rehabilitated\nand sold to qualified homebuyers in Arizona, Colorado,\nNew Mexico, California, Texas, Illinois, Pennsylvania,\nMaryland, and Washington, DC.\nFirst Look has proven to be such a success that it is now\nreplicated by others in the industry. In 2011, Fannie Mae\nsold an average of 3,000 First Look homes per month. \nFor tens of thousands of First Look buyers, a Fannie Mae-\nowned foreclosed property has become a family home. \nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n23\nEmployee Volunteerism\nOur commitment to making a positive difference in the\ncommunities where we live and work is reflected in our \nmission, our people, and our long-standing spirit of \nvolunteerism and community support.\nEmployee volunteer efforts in 2011 not only aligned with\nand deepened the impact of Fannie Mae's business, but\nalso helped build and strengthen relationships with the\ncommunities we serve. In 2011, 50 percent of our employ-\nees volunteered over 40,000 hours with more than 500\nlocal community organizations on a wide range of projects\nand initiatives.\nWe encourage employees to use their skills and time to \noptimize their contributions to America's communities.\nHere are just a few of the ways our people made a differ-\nence in 2011:\nI Over 2,000 Fannie Mae employees volunteered nearly\n12,000 hours with local non-profits nationwide to help\nserve the homeless. \nI During the holidays, Fannie Mae Board members and\nemployees nationwide worked with more than 10 non-\nprofits to purchase and deliver gifts, toys, and food for\nnearly 500 children and families in need. \nI Over 500 employees participated in more than 10 bor-\nrower outreach events through the Making Home Afford-\nable Program, Know Your Options®, and other foreclosure\nprevention efforts. Through these activities, employees\ndonated more than 4,300 hours to help thousands of\nfamilies across the country keep their homes.\nI More than 200 Fannie Mae employees contributed over\n2,000 hours of labor to help build and rehabilitate 37 \naffordable homes. \nI Through board membership opportunities, more than \n80 employees volunteered more than 2,400 hours \napplying their professional knowledge and expertise to\nhelp non-profits become stronger, more sustainable \norganizations in their local communities.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nFannie Mae has a long-standing commitment to diversity\nand inclusion as part of our ongoing work to support \nAmerica's communities. We recognize the tremendous \nopportunities to create value by leveraging the unique \ntalents and abilities of Fannie Mae's workforce.\nIn 2011, Fannie Mae's office of diversity and inclusion (ODI)\nsupported professional development programs to help \nemployees improve critical business skills to serve cus-\ntomers and communities more effectively. Our mentoring\nand employee engagement activities help ensure that \nemployees are building strong relationships across divi-\nsions and can continue to learn and grow throughout their\ncareers. Fannie Mae has received numerous awards for\nleadership in diversity, and we continue to actively seek\nways to enhance current programs and create new, more\ninnovative opportunities for employees.\nThe ODI also supports 10 Employee Resource Groups \n(ERGs) that promote cultural awareness and are aligned\naround common interests and goals. Our ERGs provide \nmarket intelligence, serve as business advisors on cultural\ncompetencies, and work to ensure that all voices are heard\non important business issues. For example, the Muslim ERG\nand Christian Salt and Light ERG collaborated to conduct\nsuccessful foreclosure outreach events for hundreds of\nfamilies at risk of losing their homes. ERGs also supported\nmany volunteer initiatives that helped connect Fannie Mae\nwith underserved communities.\nMaking a Difference \nin the Communities \nWhere We Live and Work\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n24\nWe align our business strategies with diversity and inclu-\nsion efforts to further support lenders, partners, and multi-\ncultural communities. In 2011, the ODI sponsored a lender\ntraining program that helped customers increase their\nawareness of the importance of diversity and inclusion in\nhousing finance. We also supported financial literacy events\nfor women in multicultural communities.\nCommunity Investments\nIn an environment of declining resources and increasing\ndemand, Fannie Mae’s community investment and engage-\nment activities continue to be an important resource for\npartners who are committed to addressing the nation’s\nhousing challenges.\nFannie Mae makes grants to well-established non-profit \norganizations that work to address housing-related issues\nand build stronger communities. All investments are moni-\ntored regularly to ensure that our funds and our people are\nbeing effectively and appropriately leveraged to produce the\nmost benefit.\nIn 2011, Fannie Mae’s investments in non-profit \norganizations supported:\nI Foreclosure prevention counseling for more than\n250,000 at-risk borrowers, helping over 100,000 \nfamilies avoid foreclosure.\nI Acquisition of more than 4,400 foreclosed properties \nto help stabilize neighborhoods. \nI Rehabilitation of more than 3,700 foreclosed properties\nand the sale of over 4,800 REO properties. \nI Education of more than 26,000 potential homebuyers\nin hard-hit markets. \nI Preservation of more than 10,000 affordable \nhousing units. \nI Production of more than 1,300 affordable housing units\nand development of a pipeline of over 6,800 units. \nI Delivery of more than 1,100 units of permanent \nsupportive housing and development of a pipeline \nof over 1,600 units.\nHelp the Homeless® \nFannie Mae’s commitment \nto housing-related issues \nincludes partnering with\ncommunities to address homelessness. Now in its 25th\nyear, Fannie Mae’s Help the Homeless (HTH) Program is\nthe nation’s largest fundraising model focused on building\nthe capacity of non-profits working to prevent and end\nhomelessness. In 2011, HTH raised more than $6.2 million\nand engaged more than 115,000 community members on\nbehalf of nearly 100 non-profit beneficiary organizations.\nThis fundraising and community engagement enabled the\nbeneficiaries to assist more than 180,000 clients and sup-\nply more than 6,300 housing units.\nThe company’s focus on increasing the efficiency and \neffectiveness of HTH continues to evolve. In 2012, we will\ntransition from the centralized walk on the National Mall \nin Washington, DC, to regional community walks that will \ninclude five additional markets. Based on best practices\nfrom the historically successful DC-based model, the \ncommunity walk model places an emphasis on education\nand awareness as well as donations, sponsorships, and vol-\nunteerism.\nSince its inception in 1988, HTH has raised more than $90\nmillion, positively impacting thousands of families, children,\nand veterans who were homeless or at risk of homeless-\nness. Fannie Mae remains committed to partnering with\ncommunity-based non-profit organizations who provide\nhousing opportunities and critical services to these individ-\nuals and families.\nMaking a Difference in the Communities Where We Live and Work\nFannie Mae Mission Report 2012\n25\nMaking a Difference in the Communities Where We Live and Work\nLisa Brown is an outstanding example of Fannie\nMae employees who share their professional\nskills and expertise through volunteerism and\nmake a measurable impact in the community.\nIn 2009, Lisa, who works in Fannie Mae’s legal\ndivision, was selected to participate in our Non-\nprofit Board Leadership Training program. After\ntaking part in an intensive two-day training\nworkshop, she was paired with a board opportu-\nnity at Bright Beginnings, an organization \nfocused on preventing homelessness in Wash-\nington, DC. The opportunity allowed her to focus\non an issue she is deeply passionate about\nwhile giving her the chance to serve and make \na direct impact in her own neighborhood.\nBright Beginnings is a beneficiary of Fannie\nMae’s Help the Homeless Program. Over the\npast two decades, the organization has pro-\nvided education and therapeutic services that\nprepare homeless infants, toddlers, and pre-\nschool-aged children for kindergarten. They also provide\non-site support services for the children's families and\nother essential services and referrals.\n“Lisa has enthusiastically pitched in at every opportunity\nto help Bright Beginnings succeed,” says Dr. Betty Jo\nGaines, the executive director of Bright Beginnings. “She\nis always ready, willing, and able to lend her expertise and\ncompassion to everything we do. She is one of our most\nenthusiastic advocates inside and outside Fannie Mae.” \nAfter being selected to the Bright Beginnings’ board\nnearly three years ago, Lisa also served on the finance\nand corporate governance committees where her \nprofessional skills were best suited.

Working with our partners, we’re doing every-\nthing we can to help families avoid foreclosure and keep their homes whenever possible. \nEveryone with a stake in housing — from families to lenders and others — wants a\nstronger housing market. At Fannie Mae, we’re helping build a stronger foundation for\nhousing — one based on returning to common sense lending standards and redeﬁning\nsensible risk. \nWe are also committed to creating long-term value to help build a stable, sustainable\nhousing market for the future. \nThe work that we do aﬀects families and neighborhoods across the country, every day.\nThis report illustrates how we are putting our resources to work for the housing market,\nfor communities across the country, and for the American people.\nPhil Laskawy\nChairman of the Board\nMike Williams\nPresident and Chief Executive Oﬃcer\nA Message from \nPhil Laskawy \nand Mike Williams\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n4\nWho Is Fannie Mae Today?\nA company on a mission. Fannie Mae exists to serve Amer-\nica’s housing market. We’re a national mortgage ﬁnance\ncompany, but we don’t oﬀer home loans. We stand behind\nmortgage lenders — local and national banks, thrifts, credit\nunions, and other ﬁnancial institutions in all 50 states — to\nbuy the mortgage loans they originate, replenishing their\nfunds so they can lend to other homeowners and apartment\nowners. Lenders and Fannie Mae work together to help fami-\nlies buy homes or reﬁnance their mortgages. Similarly, we\nkeep funds ﬂowing to support aﬀordable rental housing.\nFannie Mae has served at the center of the U.S. mortgage\nmarket since 1938. Our mission to provide liquidity, stability,\nand aﬀordability to the U.S. housing market has never been\nmore critical than it is right now.\nA vital role in the market. Fannie Mae plays an even greater\nrole in the housing market today as our nation recovers from\nthe worst housing crisis since the Great Depression. In \nuncertain economic times, funds for mortgages tend to dry\nup as investors who supply ﬁnancing leave the market. That\nthreatens to stall mortgage lending, construction, home\nsales, and ﬁnancing for apartments. And since housing \nactivity represents about 15 percent of our gross domestic\nproduct, the entire U.S. economy suﬀers. Fannie Mae’s role\nin the market — and our charter requiring us to serve in all\ncommunities at all times, good and bad — gives us a unique\nability to respond to market challenges. When others pull\nback or leave the market, we step forward.\nAn urgent responsibility. Our mandate is to keep money\nﬂowing to mortgage lenders and to make sure people can\nstill buy, reﬁnance, or rent housing. We launched an un-\nprecedented eﬀort to help struggling homeowners keep\nmaking their mortgage payments and avoid losing their\nhomes. Today, we continue to focus on delivering on our \nimportant mission, building a sustainable foundation for\nhousing for the future, and strengthening our company so\nwe can better serve the housing market and families.\nHow Has Fannie Mae Helped?\nSteady, measurable progress. The housing market is \nshowing some signs of improvement but the recovery is \nstill fragile, and many homeowners continue to struggle. \nWe have made important progress since being placed in\nconservatorship, but we have much more work to do.\nI We provided nearly $1.5 trillion in funds to the mortgage\nmarket in 2009 and 2010.\nI We are building a new book of business (loans acquired\nfrom 2009 forward) that we expect to be proﬁtable and\nmanaging losses on our legacy book (loans prior to\n2009) through our foreclosure prevention eﬀorts.\nI In 2009 and 2010, we helped more than one million\nfamilies buy homes and more than four million families\nreﬁnance into lower-cost, safer mortgages. Approxi-\nmately 1.95 million of these mortgages are on proper-\nties owned by families earning at or below the median\nincome in their area.\nI We helped more than 700,000 homeowners struggling\nto pay their mortgages work out their loans in 2009 and\n2010. That helped to protect neighborhoods, home\nprices, and the housing market. \nI We are also a leading provider of capital to the rental\nhousing market. In conjunction with our multifamily\nlenders and housing partners, Fannie Mae provided \napproximately $37 billion in debt ﬁnancing for the rental\nhousing market in 2009 and 2010.\nI We continue our commitment to aﬀordable rental hous-\ning. In 2009 and 2010, 87 percent and 91 percent, \nrespectively, of the multifamily units we ﬁnanced were\naﬀordable to families earning at or below the median \nincome in their area.\nI In 2010, on top of our daily work, Fannie Mae employees\ngave more than 69,000 volunteer hours to eﬀorts \nfocused on preventing foreclosures, strengthening\ncommunities, and addressing homelessness. Our \ncommitment is both professional and personal.\nIntroduction\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n5\nIntroduction\nThese numbers demonstrate that Fannie Mae and our part-\nners are playing a meaningful role in supporting America’s\nhousing market and serving America’s families.\nHow Is Fannie Mae Moving Forward?\nThe housing recovery remains uneven. Creating solutions\nwill require practical, eﬀective, and long-term changes\nacross the housing market.\nFannie Mae has conducted focused market research to \nunderstand evolving consumer attitudes and their potential\nimpact on the housing market. Our National Housing \nSurvey was developed to identify, assess, and track emerg-\ning consumer attitudes on important housing issues. Our\nOwn-Rent analyses examine why Americans choose either\nto buy or to rent their homes. Our extensive analyses also\nprovide insights into speciﬁc demographic, income, and \neducational groups.\nOver the past year, our research has identiﬁed several \nimportant themes. For example, the vast majority of Ameri-\ncans continue to believe that owning a home makes more\nsense for them than renting. They want to own primarily \nfor non-ﬁnancial reasons, which include obtaining a good\nplace to raise their children, promoting safety, and having\nmore space. Additionally, the perception that owning a\nhome is a safe investment remains strong but has declined\nmeaningfully from levels seen prior to the housing market\ndownturn. And, many Americans, especially renters, have\ngrown more cautious and realistic about homeownership.\n(To access the complete survey, visit\nwww.fanniemae.com/media/survey.) \nAt Fannie Mae, we are focusing on ﬁve actions to build a\nstronger, more sustainable foundation for housing:\nI Keep liquidity ﬂowing. In 2010, we estimate our compet-\nitive market share was almost 40 percent of single-\nfamily and approximately 35 percent of multifamily\nmortgage ﬁnancing. We continue our commitment to\nour fundamental mission — providing mortgage liquidity\nin all cycles, good and bad.\nI Help distressed homeowners. Everyone loses when\nfamilies are faced with a foreclosure. The cost to home-\nowners, their neighborhoods, the market, and to our\ncompany can be severe. We will continue to ﬁnd ways to\nhelp. We have one of the largest foreclosure prevention\noperations in the country. Our eﬀorts help stabilize \ncommunities and help Fannie Mae avoid losses, which\nbeneﬁts taxpayers.\nI Encourage sustainable lending. Fannie Mae has\nstrengthened lending standards to help ensure that\nworking Americans who buy homes can aﬀord them\nover the long term. We are emphasizing long-term,\nﬁxed-rate mortgages — loans that protect homeowners\nfrom interest rate swings. Through our Loan Quality \nInitiative, we are helping minimize future risk for borrow-\ners, lenders, and Fannie Mae by requiring borrowers \nto provide more information about their credit status\nearlier in the process and by enhancing property \nappraisals. We are also creating tools for lenders to \nbetter understand the quality of a loan before they sell it\nto Fannie Mae. In addition, we are committed to working\nwith our regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency\n(FHFA), and others to develop a better model for servic-\ning mortgages to help reduce risk, increase ﬂexibility,\nand improve service for borrowers.\nI Support rental housing. As demographics change, de-\nmand for quality aﬀordable rental housing will continue\nto grow. Fannie Mae provides critical capital to help meet\nthis need and has guaranteed the credit risk of more\nthan $1 of every $5 of outstanding multifamily debt.\nI Build a better company. We are working to improve \nperformance. Loans acquired since the start of 2009\ncomprise more than 40 percent of our book of business,\nand we expect them to be proﬁtable over their lifecycle.\nAs we continue to build this new book of business, our\nforeclosure prevention eﬀorts help reduce losses on our\nlegacy book of business. We are also driving operational\nexcellence to strengthen our company’s capabilities, \nreduce risk, and be a responsible steward of the re-\nsources we’ve been provided.\nWe know the mortgage market will change in the years\nahead. As we prepare for change, Fannie Mae is focused on\ncreating value and delivering on our responsibilities to the\nU.S. housing market. \nOur eﬀorts are making a diﬀerence to families and commu-\nnities across the country. We will continue to work with \nindustry partners, lenders, and families to build a stronger\nhousing market for the future.\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n6\nInvestor capital is essential to keep the mortgage market\nfunctioning. During the housing crisis, many mortgage \ninvestors left the market or sharply reduced their involve-\nment. Fannie Mae has supported mortgage lenders with the\nfunds they need to provide ﬁnancing for families, reﬁnance\nloans, and ﬁnance multifamily housing at aﬀordable rates. \nSupporting Homeownership\nFannie Mae plays a signiﬁcant role in providing liquidity to\nthe single-family mortgage market. The interest rate for\n30-year ﬁxed-rate conforming mortgages is lower than \nthe rate for “jumbo” mortgage loans (or loans above our\ncurrent $417,000 limit in most markets and $729,750 in\ncertain high-cost areas).\nI In 2010, Fannie Mae worked with approximately 1,100\nlenders to provide ﬁnancing for 599,000 borrowers to\nbuy homes and for 2.1 million homeowners to reﬁnance\ntheir loans.\nI Our Reﬁ Plus™ initiative, which streamlines the reﬁ-\nnancing process, served approximately 659,000 of \nour borrowers.\nAmerica’s Favorite Mortgage\nThe 30-year ﬁxed-rate mortgage is the most popular\nchoice for America’s homeowners. It provides predictable\npayments that protect homeowners from interest rate\nswings. We believe this creates more stability for borrowers\nand for the housing market. Since the 30-year ﬁxed-rate\nmortgage was developed, it has enabled millions of families\nto buy homes.\nFannie Mae emphasizes long-term, ﬁxed-rate mortgages\nthat are pre-payable (without penalty) as a way to support\nsustainable homeownership. Fixed-rate mortgages \naccounted for 83 percent of all outstanding single-family\nmortgages according to FHFA’s latest available data.\nSupporting Smaller Lenders\nThe credit crunch has hit small and mid-sized lenders espe-\ncially hard. These lenders are particularly vulnerable when\ncredit lines dry up and investors reduce their interest in \nacquiring mortgage-related assets. Fannie Mae met the \nliquidity needs of many small to mid-sized lenders by pur-\nchasing over $80 billion of their mortgage loan production\nin 2010. \nWe worked with various trade associations and aﬃnity\ngroups, whose membership includes many of the lenders in\nthis segment, to help them realize the value of their Fannie\nMae relationship. We dedicated a team of people who were\nfocused on the unique needs of the lenders’ business \nmodels to help the lenders meet their speciﬁc objectives. \nIn addition, we provided classroom training on mortgage\nlending fundamentals for more than 1,000 employees of our\ncustomers in various cities around the country, and oﬀered\nfree access via eFannieMae.com to hundreds of live Web\nseminars, recorded tutorials, and job aids.\nWhat Lenders Have to Say About \nFannie Mae\n“It is organizations like ours that will help rebuild and\nreaﬃrm the conﬁdence in the housing market that\nhas been lacking. Small businesses like mine are\nthose that employ locally, that continue to pay taxes,\ncontinue to eke out a living. ... We know Fannie Mae\nhas made us a priority. They go above and beyond in\ninvolving us in events, in information distribution so\nthat we can grow our business soundly and\nresponsibly.”\n— Chris George, Founder and President, CMG Mortgage,\na leading mortgage bank located in San Ramon, CA\nProviding Liquidity and \nAﬀordability to the \nHousing Market\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n7\nProviding Liquidity and Aﬀordability to the Housing Market\nCredit Union Partnerships\nMany families utilize credit unions, or cooperative ﬁnancial\ninstitutions that make loans and provide other banking\nservices to their members, when obtaining a mortgage. \nHistorically, credit unions kept mortgages on their balance\nsheets because they represented solid, reliable assets.\nCredit unions had good track records on borrower screen-\ning and low foreclosure risk.\nHowever, the weak economy has prompted many credit\nunions to look for new ways to manage their core assets\nand ensure their mortgage loan liquidity. Earning invest-\nment income is always important, but not-for-proﬁt credit\nunions also maintain a commitment to serve their mem-\nbers’ ﬁnancing needs when buying homes or making other\nmajor expenditures.\nFannie Mae helps credit unions balance their portfolios,\nfreeing up capital for new lending and mitigating risk. We \ndo so by purchasing new or seasoned loans in exchange for\ncash, thus replenishing their supply of funds for additional\nlending, or for a mortgage-backed security to hold in their\nportfolios or sell to an investor. In 2010, Fannie Mae pur-\nchased $21.3 billion in loans originated by credit unions.\nCombating Mortgage Fraud\nAccording to the FBI, \"Combating signiﬁcant mortgage\nfraud is a priority, because mortgage lending and the\nhousing market have a signiﬁcant overall eﬀect on \nthe nation's economy.\" The U.S. enjoys accessible, \naﬀordable mortgage funding, based largely on investor\ninterest in mortgage-backed investments. Lack of \ninvestor conﬁdence in the mortgages backing those\ninvestments could reduce demand, making mortgages\nmore diﬃcult and costly to obtain.\nFannie Mae is committed to preserving the quality of\nour mortgages and we are actively working to combat\nfraud. We partner with lenders, law enforcement, non-\nproﬁts, and others to prevent or stop fraud schemes\nand develop solutions to prevent future losses due to\nfraud. Our eﬀorts include:\nI\nPrevention — Fannie Mae’s Loan Quality Initiative\nprovides tools to help lenders identify and avoid\npotential fraud.\nI\nEducation — Fannie Mae’s Mortgage Fraud Program\noﬀers live and Web-based education on fraud\ntrends. Our Mortgage Fraud Resources Web page\non eFannieMae.com features the latest fraud pre-\nvention tools, information, and presentations. \nI\nEnforcement — Fannie Mae enforces our lenders’\ncontractual representations regarding mortgage\nfraud, reinforcing accountability for the quality of\nloans sold to us. We report mortgage fraud to FHFA\nand ultimately to law enforcement through the \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network.\nFannie Mae also invests in eﬀorts to combat fraud \ndirected at homeowners.  One recent success is the\nLoan Modiﬁcation Scam Prevention Network (LMSPN)\nwe founded in collaboration with the U.S. Department\nof Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Freddie\nMac, and a variety of banks and nonproﬁt organiza-\ntions to assist homeowners victimized by foreclosure\nrescue schemes. (For more information, visit \nLoanScamAlert.org and PreventLoanScams.org.)\nThe coalition conducts a national media outreach\ncampaign to educate the public on potential scams\nand facilitates law enforcement referrals and prose-\ncution.  Since the launch of the LMSPN database in\nFebruary 2010, more than 10,000 homeowners have\nreported scams or potential scams, totaling over \n$27 million in lost money.\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n8\nProviding Liquidity and Aﬀordability to the Housing Market\nRentals as a Key Component\nof the Nation’s Housing \nAs demographics in this country change, demand for \naﬀordable rental housing will continue to grow. According\nto the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS),\nthe number of renter households in America is expected to\nsurge over the next ten years. Depending on immigration,\nthat growth could be anywhere from 3.8 million to 5 million\nrental households over the ten-year period.\nNotes: High immigration projection assumes immigration rises from 1.1 million in 2005\nto 1.5 million in 2020, as estimated by the Census Bureau's 2008 population projec-\ntions. Low immigration projection assumes immigration is half the Census Bureau's\nprojected totals. Source: JCHS household projections.\nSupporting Multifamily \nRental Housing\nIn the wake of the housing crisis, many Americans seeking \na viable and more aﬀordable housing option are choosing\nrenting over buying. Fannie Mae has long played a signiﬁ-\ncant role in providing ﬁnancing for the multifamily rental\nhousing sector and continues to do so, largely by packaging\nmultifamily loans into mortgage-backed securities and \nproviding a credit guarantee on the securities. Fannie \nMae’s Multifamily Mortgage Business has several business \nchannels that focus on numerous types of multifamily\nhousing including: \nI Conventional rental properties (large and small) \nthat provide safe, decent, and aﬀordable housing; \nI Rent-restricted housing that is targeted to lower-\nincome populations; \nI Seniors housing, including independent and \nassisted living; \nI Manufactured housing communities;\nI Cooperative housing; and\nI Student housing.\nLast year, in conjunction with our lender and housing \npartners, Fannie Mae provided nearly $17 billion in debt \nﬁnancing for the rental housing market. We did this by \nacquiring approximately 2,300 multifamily mortgages\nacross the country.\nOur ﬁnancing supports both the workforce rental and rent-\nrestricted housing markets. Approximately 91 percent of\nthe multifamily units we ﬁnanced in 2010 were aﬀordable\nto families earning at or below the area median income for\ntheir communities.\nSmall Multifamily Rental Loans\nSmaller rental properties are critically important because\nthey provide many of the housing opportunities needed for\nworking families. However, ﬁnancing these properties can\nbe challenging. Fannie Mae plays a key role in ensuring the\nsmall multifamily loan market has the liquidity it needs.\nThe lending market for smaller rental properties is frag-\nmented, with more than 2,600 lenders originating an \naverage of six small loans each. Smaller rental property \nﬁnancing also tends to rely on a broad range of borrowers,\nincluding individual investors, entrepreneurs, or smaller\ncommercial businesses of varying credit proﬁles that invest\nin a limited number of properties. This can create ﬁnancial,\nunderwriting, and credit issues for national investors in\nthese loans, which limits the supply of low-cost ﬁnancing. \nFannie Mae helps ensure that the small rental property loan\nmarket has the funding it needs. “Small multifamily loans”\nare loans under $3 million (or $5 million in higher-cost\nareas). Over the past ten years, we have developed a dedi-\n1,500\n1,250\n1,000\n750\n500\n250\n0\n-250\n15-24\nAge of Household\nI Assuming Low Immigration   I Assuming High Immigration\nProjected Renter Household Growth, 2010-2020 (In Thousands)\n25-34\n35-44\n45-54\n55-64\n65-74\n75 and\nOver\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n9\nProviding Liquidity and Aﬀordability to the Housing Market\nSupporting Aﬀordable Housing\nFannie Mae helps provide ﬁnancing to enable Americans \nto buy or rent quality aﬀordable housing. In 2010, we \nsupported lending that served more than 750,000 low-\nincome families, including more than 87,000 very low-\nincome households.\nHousing Finance Agency Partnerships\nFannie Mae has a long-standing partnership with state\nHousing Finance Agencies (HFAs) and their nonproﬁt \ntrade association, the National Council of State Housing\nAgencies (NCSHA). These entities work to meet aﬀordable\nhousing needs across the country through a variety of\nhousing initiatives, including homeownership and rental\nhousing programs for low- and moderate-income families\nand ﬁrst-time home buyers.\nMultifamily Green Initiative\nFannie Mae’s Green Initiative assists multifamily prop-\nerty owners seeking to reduce utility costs, operate\ntheir properties more eﬃciently, and reduce their \nimpact on the environment through energy and water\neﬃciency property improvement projects and rehabili-\ntations. By focusing on energy and water eﬃciency,\nFannie Mae is helping maintain the quality and aﬀord-\nability of America’s multifamily rental housing. Our\nwork toward this goal includes:\nI\nEstablishing the Green Rental Housing Task Force\n— Fannie Mae has organized a task force to bring\ntogether a broad range of industry experts to \nprovide information for the Green Initiative strat-\negy. The group is also working to integrate energy\neﬃciency performance metrics into multifamily \nunderwriting and existing loan products.\nI\nRehabilitating Fannie Mae-owned properties — \nIn select cases, Fannie Mae is acquiring and \nrehabilitating multifamily properties that have \nentered into foreclosure. By investing in these\nproperties, Fannie Mae is helping to keep housing\naﬀordable for families while improving the quality\nof the properties. Fannie Mae intends to sell the\nproperties after the market has stabilized, thereby \nreturning value to the market. \ncated small multifamily loan platform to provide consistent\nliquidity to the small rental property loan market and ﬁ-\nnanced more than $60 billion of small multifamily loans.\nDuring 2010, Fannie Mae acquired 1,177 small multifamily\nloans totaling $2.3 billion, which accounted for 51 percent\nof our total multifamily loan count. As of December 31,\n2010, we had a $33 billion book of business in more than\n29,000 small multifamily loans. These properties tend to\nbe more aﬀordable and concentrated in urban areas in\nproximity to transportation and jobs, helping to lower the\ncost of living.\nFannie Mae's Signiﬁcant Impact \non Aﬀordable Rentals\nFannie Mae plays a signiﬁcant role in funding aﬀordable\nrental housing for American families.\nSource: Fannie Mae Annual Housing Activities Reports 2002-2010\n600,000\n500,000\n400,000\n300,000\n200,000\n100,000\n0\n2002\nI Affordable at no more than 60 percent of median income\nI Affordable at more than 60 percent but no more than 100 percent of \nmedian income\nI Affordable at more than 100 percent of median income\nI Not provided by lender\nDistribution of Rental Units Financed with Multifamily \nMortgage and Securities Purchases by Fannie Mae 2002-2010\nas per the Annual Housing Activities Reports\n2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\ndraw NIBP funding through the end of 2011.

In October 2010, Fannie Mae \nissued a letter to all servicers instructing them to work\nclosely with the HFAs participating in the Hardest-Hit Fund\nprogram to assist borrowers as part of the HHF \nUnemployment Program.\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n10\nProviding Liquidity and Aﬀordability to the Housing Market\nHFA Single-Family Business\nIn 2006, Fannie Mae entered into an Aﬃnity Agreement\nwith state HFAs and NCSHA. The agreement provides \npreferred pricing and terms to HFAs in exchange for high-\nperforming loans. To date, 34 HFAs have participated and\ndelivered approximately $6.4 billion in volume. In 2010,\nFannie Mae purchased more than 3,700 HFA loans, with a\nprincipal balance of $593 million. Of this volume, approxi-\nmately 69 percent was purchased through the Aﬃnity\nAgreement.

Section 8 provides fed-\neral housing assistance to occupants in the form of rental\nsubsidies. If the property had been sold to a for-proﬁt\nbuyer, the new owner could have decided to stop oﬀering\nSection 8 housing, forcing the more than 200 low-income\nseniors living in the complex to ﬁnd new homes. Adding to\nthe challenge, Section 8 housing in the area was scarce,\nand the displaced residents would have had to go through\nthe process of applying for Section 8 vouchers.\nA local, well-known nonproﬁt organization committed to\npreserving aﬀordable housing decided to buy the property,\nentering into a purchase agreement with the owner. HUD\napproved the borrower so the building could continue \nto provide Section 8 assistance, Fannie Mae agreed to \npurchase the loan, and the nonproﬁt acquired the property\n— successfully preserving more than 200 units of aﬀord-\nable housing. \nSince the organization was a nonproﬁt, when it assumed\nownership of the building it became eligible for a property\ntax reduction. Fannie Mae worked closely with the group\nand the lender to approve additional ﬁnancing through a\nsupplemental loan based on its new savings, completing\nthe process in just one month. This allowed the nonproﬁt to\nrecoup a portion of its equity, enabling it to invest more into\nthe property for enhancements and to preserve additional\nhousing properties in the area to help other underprivileged\nseniors and families.\nAs part of our eﬀort to support aﬀordable housing, Fannie\nMae completes hundreds of preservation transactions\nevery year. In 2010 alone, Fannie Mae provided $643 \nmillion in ﬁnancing that supported the preservation of\napartment rent restrictions for over 14,000 aﬀordable\nrental units.\nRural Aﬀordable Housing: \nHancock County 538 Loan\nIn Carthage, IL, a developer aﬃliated with the local\nhospital sought to build a 21-unit supportive living\ncomplex for senior citizens nearby. More than half of\nthe apartments would be reserved for persons with\nlow incomes. The project was particularly important\nto the community because the area had a shortage\nof supportive housing for the elderly.\nIn many instances, developers looking to build small\nmultifamily unit projects in rural markets have a \ndiﬃcult time securing funding. The income these\nprojects generate from rents often cannot support\nthe ﬁxed operating costs involved, including debt\npayments. The developer for this project was also\nlooking to fund the project at a time when investor\ninterest was scarce. However, in this case, one of\nFannie Mae’s approved multifamily aﬀordable\nlenders stepped up and worked closely with the \ndeveloper to facilitate ﬁnancing for the project.\nThe project was able to qualify for federal low-income\nhousing tax credits, which resulted in less debt and\nmore aﬀordable rents. The lender then brought the\nloan to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)\nand Fannie Mae. As part of its Rural Development\n(RD) 538 program, which encourages partnerships\nbetween RD, private lenders, and public agencies, \nthe USDA agreed to guarantee 90 percent of the\nloan. Fannie Mae worked closely with the USDA and\nthe approved lender to move the deal forward, and\nthe project was able to secure the necessary perma-\nnent ﬁnancing.\nToday, this supportive living complex is home for\nmore than 21 senior citizens and an important \nanchor for the Carthage community. It’s also a\nstrong example of how Fannie Mae can work with \nthe USDA and approved lenders to facilitate ﬁnanc-\ning and development in rural America.\nHousing Goals and Duty to Serve \nUnderserved Markets\nHousing Goals\nFannie Mae is subject to aﬀordable housing goals estab-\nlished by FHFA. Last year, the structure of these goals\nchanged. \nSingle-Family\nOur 2010 and 2011 single-family housing goal benchmarks,\nand our 2010 performance against these benchmarks, are\noutlined below. Our 2010 results have not been validated \nby FHFA, and after validation they may diﬀer from the \nresults reported below. Although we did not meet all of our\nsingle-family housing goal benchmarks, we may still meet\nour goals. In addition to the benchmarks, our single-family\nhousing goals performance will be measured against the\nshare of goals-qualifying originations in the primary mort-\ngage market. We will be in compliance with the housing\ngoals if we meet either the benchmarks or market share\nmeasures.\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n12\nProviding Liquidity and Aﬀordability to the Housing Market\nMultifamily\nFHFA also established a new multifamily housing goal \nand subgoal. For each of 2010 and 2011, our multifamily\nmortgage acquisitions must ﬁnance at least 177,750 units \naﬀordable to low-income families, and at least 42,750 \nunits aﬀordable to very low-income families. There is no\nmarket-based alternative measurement for the multifamily\ngoals. Our 2010 results were 212,768 and 53,184 units, \nrespectively.\nDuty to Serve\nFHFA will also require GSEs to provide market leadership \nin three speciﬁc areas: aﬀordable housing preservation,\nmanufactured housing, and rural areas. Fannie Mae is\npreparing a plan of action for implementation when FHFA\nissues the ﬁnal Duty to Serve rule.\nOther Aﬀordable Housing Contributions\nFannie Mae oﬀers specialized mortgage ﬁnancing solutions\nthat help increase the supply of aﬀordable owned and rental\nhousing as well as preserve the existing inventory.\nSingle-Family\nOur single-family acquisitions include several products that\naddress speciﬁc housing needs. For instance, during 2010,\nFannie Mae purchased:\nI $831 million in mortgages targeted speciﬁcally to lower-\nincome and/or ﬁrst-time home buyers through banks\nand state housing ﬁnance agencies.\nI $944 million in mortgages secured by manufactured\nhomes.\nI $138 million in single-family mortgages in rural areas.\nMultifamily\nOur multifamily mortgage business provided more than \n$1.4 billion in aﬀordable lending in 2010 including:\nI $643 million in mortgages that preserved over 14,000\nrent-restricted aﬀordable units.\nI $804 million in ﬁnancing that supported over 11,000\nunits of rental housing to targeted populations, including\nnearly 1,300 units for the homeless and more than 6,700\nunits for elderly who rely on Medicaid.\nSingle-Family \nNumber of\nHousing Goals\nResult\nBenchmark\nMortgages\nLow-income families1\nhome purchases\n25.1%\n27.0%\n120,445\nVery low-income families2\nhome purchases\n7.2\n8.0\n34,680\nLow-income areas \n(with disaster areas)3\nhome purchases\n24.0\n24.0\n115,040\nLow-income areas\n(without disaster areas)4\nhome purchases\n12.4\n13.0\n59,184\nLow-income families1\nreﬁnancing\n20.9\n21.0\n417,474\n(1)  Families with income no higher than 80 percent of area median income.\n(2)  Families with income no higher than 50 percent of area median income.\n(3)  Families in low-income census tracts, moderate-income families in minority\ncensus tracts, or moderate-income families in designated disaster areas.\n(4)  Families in low-income census tracts or moderate-income families in \nminority census tracts.\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n13\nFannie Mae is committed to helping struggling homeowners\nand preventing foreclosures whenever possible and, when\nforeclosures are unavoidable, putting properties back \nto productive use to help protect property values.\nHelping Families \nAvoid Foreclosure\nFannie Mae works with mortgage servicers, housing coun-\nselors, and other partners to help distressed homeowners\nunderstand their options and ﬁnd the best solution to meet\ntheir needs. Our goal is to help as many families as possible\nstay in their homes, protect property values in communities\nacross the country, and build a stronger foundation for the\nU.S. housing market.\nAs part of our foreclosure prevention eﬀorts, Fannie Mae\nplays two distinct and central roles in the Administration’s\nMaking Home Aﬀordable Program. The Making Home \nAﬀordable Program consists primarily of the Home Aﬀord-\nable Reﬁnance Program (HARP), under which we acquire or\nguarantee loans that are reﬁnancings of mortgage loans we\nown or guarantee, and Freddie Mac does the same, and the\nHome Aﬀordable Modiﬁcation Program (HAMP), which \nprovides for the modiﬁcation of mortgage loans owned or\nguaranteed by us or Freddie Mac, as well as other mortgage\nloans. These two programs were designed to expand the\nnumber of borrowers who can reﬁnance or modify their\nmortgages to achieve a monthly payment that is more \naﬀordable now and into the future or to obtain a more sta-\nble loan product, such as a ﬁxed-rate mortgage in lieu of an \nadjustable-rate mortgage. We participate in the Making\nHome Aﬀordable Program, and our sellers and servicers\noﬀer HARP and HAMP to Fannie Mae borrowers. We also\nserve as Treasury’s program administrator for HAMP and\nother initiatives under the Making Home Aﬀordable Program.\nIn 2010, we completed more than 500,000 mortgage loan\nworkouts, including more than 440,000 solutions — such\nas modiﬁcations, repayment plans, and forbearances —\nthat allowed families to keep their homes. Details of our \neﬀorts include:\nI Completed approximately 403,000 permanent \nmodiﬁcations.\nI Completed nearly 37,000 repayment, forbearance, or\nother home retention plans.\nI Executed over 75,000 pre-foreclosure (e.g., “short”)\nsales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nI Acquired approximately 2,113,000 reﬁnance loans, \nincluding approximately 659,000 loans through the\ncompany's Reﬁ Plus™ initiative, which includes 222,000\nloans through HARP.\nIn addition, we continued to conduct extensive homeowner\neducation under our Know Your Options™ campaign and \nin-person and phone outreach through our Mortgage Help\nCenters across the country. In 2010, Fannie Mae opened\nMortgage Help Centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/Fort\nWorth, Los Angeles, Miami, and Phoenix.\nWe use direct mail and phone calls to encourage homeown-\ners to pursue foreclosure alternatives, and have also \nestablished partnerships with counseling agencies in \ncommunities to provide similar services. Also, our\nKnowYourOptions.com Web site helps educate distressed\nhomeowners about their options to avoid foreclosure and\nencourages struggling families to take action by contacting\ntheir mortgage company or a housing counselor.\nKnow Your Options™\nIn 2010, Fannie Mae launched KnowYourOptions.com, a bilin-\ngual consumer education Web site that outlines the options\nthat may be available to homeowners who are struggling with\ntheir mortgage payments and provides guidance on how \nthey can contact and work with their mortgage company to\nﬁnd solutions. The site has had more than 210,000 unique\nvisitors and has been well-received by independent reviewers\nand industry experts.\nHelping Distressed \nFamilies & Communities\nKnowYourOptions.com is part of Fannie Mae’s Know Your\nOptions consumer initiative — an unprecedented eﬀort to\nassist distressed homeowners and help them avoid foreclo-\nsure. This initiative is not only helping families, it’s also work-\ning to help stabilize communities and help Fannie Mae\nmitigate credit losses, which beneﬁts taxpayers.\nMortgage Help Centers\nOur Mortgage Help Centers are designed so that struggling\nfamilies who have a Fannie Mae mortgage can walk in and\ntalk with our staﬀ and a local counselor. We then help the\nfamilies organize their ﬁnancial documents and work with\nservicers to ﬁnd an aﬀordable and sustainable solution.\nThe Mortgage Help Centers across the country are an \nessential component of our goal to bring stability to the\nhousing market and minimize the negative impact foreclo-\nsure has on families and communities. By working quickly \nto outline the options available, struggling families can\nmake decisions to put themselves on a stronger ﬁnancial\nfooting. On average, help center staﬀ is able to process the\nmortgage and communicate an outcome to a customer in\n30 days. The services provided at our help centers are free\nof charge. These eﬀorts are creating value for the future by\nstabilizing neighborhoods. \nTurning Foreclosed \nProperties into Homes \nDespite our comprehensive foreclosure prevention eﬀorts,\nsome foreclosures cannot be avoided. When all other \noptions are exhausted and foreclosure is the end result, we\ndo our best to sell these properties quickly to people who\nwill make the properties their homes — helping to stabilize\nneighborhoods and home values. Once Fannie Mae \nacquires the properties, we focus our marketing eﬀorts \ntoward owner occupants, including ﬁrst-time home buyers.\nOne of the ways we do this is by making repairs to many of\nour properties, which makes them more attractive to\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n14\nHelping Distressed Families & Communities\nowner-occupant buyers and also makes them more eligible\nfor ﬁnancing. During 2010, Fannie Mae made repairs to\nmore than 87,000 properties.\nFannie Mae works with real estate agents to market these\nproperties directly to consumers under the HomePath™\ninitiative. Launched in 2010, HomePath.com makes avail-\nable to the public every Fannie Mae property available for\nsale. Fannie Mae also oﬀers special ﬁnancing options for\nﬁrst-time buyers with our HomePath Mortgage and Reno-\nvation Mortgage™ products. The products enable a buyer\nto purchase a Fannie Mae home with as little as 3 percent\ndown. In 2010, we also oﬀered an incentive of up to 3.5 \npercent closing cost assistance to buyers who purchased \na HomePath property as their primary residence.\nHelping Owner Occupants with First Look™\nOwner occupants are vital to any neighborhood and com-\nmunity. In an eﬀort to promote neighborhood stabilization\nthrough higher owner occupancy rates, in August of 2009\nwe created First Look. The program focuses on providing\npotential buyers who intend to live in the homes a head-\nstart to bid on HomePath properties. Owner occupants (or\nany organization using public funds) can submit an oﬀer on\na Fannie Mae property without competition from investors\nfor the ﬁrst 15 days. Fannie Mae also supports prospective\nhome buyers by partnering with public entities and non-\nproﬁts to help them take advantage of Neighborhood Sta-\nbilization Program (NSP) funds to purchase HomePath\nproperties. In 2010, Fannie Mae sold more than 120,000\nHomePath properties to owner-occupant and NSP buyers.\nHelping Stabilize Hard-Hit Neighborhoods\nStabilizing neighborhoods and building communities has\nbeen part of our mission for decades. Fannie Mae partners\nwith nonproﬁt entities across the country whose focus is\ncommunity development and neighborhood stabilization.\nSome examples of these partnerships in 2010 included\nworking with Habitat for Humanity in 25 states to sell 179\nproperties to 70 of their aﬃliates — where properties are\ntransformed into homes for owner occupants — and selling\nWhat Families are Saying about \nFannie Mae’s Mortgage Help Centers\n“I am so grateful for the opening of the Fannie Mae\nMortgage Help Center in this community. It is the best\nthing that could have ever happened to help people in\nthis community, like myself, who are struggling with\ntheir housing situations and have not received \nadequate help from their lenders.” — Culver City, CA\n200 properties to the Cuyahoga County Land Bank in Cleve-\nland, OH — where they take dilapidated properties and con-\nvert them into land for urban farms and neighborhood parks.\nAssisting Families with Stability \nand Transitioning\nRenters in foreclosed properties often face uncertainty\nthrough no fault of their own. Through our Tenant-in-Place\nrental program, Fannie Mae oﬀers these renters several\noptions that provide them the opportunity for greater sta-\nbility or time to transition to new housing. Options for\nrenters may include remaining under their pre-existing\nlease pursuant to the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure\nAct of 2009, entering into a lease with Fannie Mae, or re-\nceiving ﬁnancial assistance for relocation. When it is time\nto sell the property, Fannie Mae also works with renters\nwho may be interested in purchasing the property or with\ninvestors who would purchase the property with the intent\nof continuing the lease. Fannie Mae has helped over 13,000\nfamilies remain in their homes after foreclosure since\nthese rental initiatives were introduced in 2009. \nRehabilitation of Foreclosed Property\nHelps Revitalize Neighborhood in \nRiverside, CA\nFannie Mae’s work to put foreclosed homes to productive\nuse is having a strong impact across the country. In River-\nside County, CA, a developer bought a Fannie Mae-owned\nforeclosed property in 2010 using funds from the develop-\nment ﬁrm’s public-private partnership with the Riverside\nCounty Economic Development Agency (RivCo). The part-\nnership’s primary goal is to stabilize neighborhoods that\nhave been devastated by the foreclosure crisis and to \nensure long-term aﬀordability by requiring future sales to\nlow- and moderate-income families for the next 45 years. \nThe family — ﬁrst-time buyers — that purchased the home\nqualiﬁed for RivCo’s down payment assistance program.\nThe house is now noticeably improved and well-maintained,\nwhich is helping revitalize the surrounding neighborhood.\nThe developer also recently acquired and renovated a sec-\nond Fannie Mae foreclosed home in the same community. \nIn total, RivCo has funded the acquisition and renovation of\n18 Fannie Mae homes — and the ripple eﬀect continues as\nother homes on these streets are also noticeably enhanced.\nRedeveloped Rental Property Helps to \nAddress Homelessness in Tulsa, OK\nIn June 2010, Fannie Mae sold a 54-unit apartment com-\nplex in Tulsa, OK to a community nonproﬁt organization.\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n15\nHelping Distressed Families & Communities\nThis organization used both stimulus funds from the state\nof Oklahoma and privately raised funds, as well as HUD’s\nSupportive Housing Program and other subsidies to \nacquire, redevelop, and operate the property. The organiza-\ntion, which owns and manages a considerable portfolio of\naﬀordable housing, has begun to rehabilitate the property\nand helped the existing tenants move to other aﬀordable\nhousing units around Tulsa during the repairs.\nSome of the units will provide permanent supportive hous-\ning for chronically homeless individuals.  Others will be\nused for a program that provides an alternative to incarcer-\nation for mothers, enabling them to have regular visitation\ntime with their children as they take advantage of the social\nand educational services they need to achieve stability and\nself-suﬃciency.  The remaining units will be market-rate\nrental housing.\nForeclosed Multifamily Property in \nDearborn, MI Becomes Homeownership\nOpportunity for Tenants\nIn Dearborn, MI, a multifamily property consisting of 33 \ndetached single-family homes went into foreclosure, trans-\nferring ownership to Fannie Mae. We reached out to exist-\ning tenants who might be interested in buying their homes,\nincluding coordinating through a local broker to translate\ndocuments into Arabic and holding meetings in the local\ncommunity center. \nOur eﬀorts helped these families access the information\nthey needed to move forward.  Ultimately, many of the \nexisting tenants bought their homes — most of them ﬁrst-\ntime home buyers. This was a positive outcome for both \nthe families and their neighborhood. The homes remained\noccupied and were purchased by people with strong roots\nin the community, helping ensure stability.\nHow First Look is Helping Families\n\"We recently sold a home to a young family who had\nbeen trying for more than a year to buy a property.\nThey had made several oﬀers, only to lose the bids to\nall-cash investors. When they called me, they seemed\nreluctant to write another oﬀer. But, after I explained\nthe First Look program, they decided to give it one\nmore try. Because of First Look, they were successful\nin buying their ﬁrst home.\"\n— Christopher Suarez, Quantum Realtors\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n16\nFannie Mae is deeply committed to social responsibility\nwithin and outside of our organization.\nWorkplace and Supplier Diversity\nFannie Mae is committed to diversity and inclusion within\nour culture, our people, and our business. We strive to \ncreate an environment where employees — our greatest\nasset — can fully engage and contribute their ideas and \nperspectives toward innovative solutions that meet the\ncompany's goals and create value in the housing market.\nWe work to attract diverse talent, understanding that each\nemployee brings unique and valuable skills, perspectives,\nand experiences to Fannie Mae. We also work to develop all\nof our current employees in ways that give each individual\nthe opportunity to succeed, contribute to the company’s\nsuccess, and serve the needs of our customers, partners,\nand communities.\nFannie Mae oﬀers resource groups that bring together \nemployees who share common cultural, lifestyle, spiritual,\nprofessional, or other interests. The groups, which are open\nto all employees, are designed to help strengthen leader-\nship abilities, share and leverage cultural and business\ncompetencies, increase awareness of diverse cultures,\npositively aﬀect diverse communities, and help Fannie \nMae meet its business and mission objectives. \nAs part of our commitment to diversity, Fannie Mae also \nfocuses on the consideration of minorities; women; individu-\nals with disabilities; and minority-, women-, and disabled-\nowned businesses in all of our contracting activities.\nAdditionally, Fannie Mae supports increased procurement\nopportunities for qualiﬁed diverse suppliers that are \nSmall Businesses; Veteran-Owned Businesses; HUBZone\n(Historically Underutilized Business Zone) Businesses; \n8(a) Businesses; and Gay-, Lesbian-, Bisexual-, and Trans-\ngender-Owned Businesses in our procurement process. \nWe take diversity into account as we make decisions in our \nevaluation process.\nFannie Mae participates in numerous business opportunity\nfairs and conferences across the country. We are also\nmembers of several business councils that address diverse\nsupplier business concerns. Our partnership and support\nextends to organizations and events within the real estate\nand ﬁnancial services industries, as well as to entities dedi-\ncated to creating greater access to business opportunities\nfor diverse individuals and ﬁrms across the economy.\nEnvironmental Stewardship — \nUrbana Data Center Fifth Anniversary\nIn 2010, Fannie Mae’s technology center in Urbana, MD —\nthe nation’s ﬁrst LEED®-certiﬁed data center — marked its\nﬁfth anniversary. The energy-eﬃcient design has reduced\nenergy consumption by 35 percent. This has produced a\nnet savings of $340,000 annually or $1.7 million over its\nﬁve years of operation.\nThe LEED designation, awarded by the U.S. Green Building\nCouncil (USGBC) in June 2005, recognized a number of \nenergy-saving innovations. For example, the data center\nhas a unique irrigation design that uses waste water from\nthe cooling plant and captured rain water. In addition, its\nlandscaping features drought-tolerant plants. As a result of\nthese factors, the facility preserves nearly 13,000 \ngallons of municipal water per day from consumption and\nwaste, and has saved more than 23 million gallons over \nﬁve years. \nThe LEED rating system is a voluntary, consensus-based\nnational standard for developing high-performance, sus-\ntainable buildings. LEED certiﬁcation distinguishes building\nprojects that have demonstrated a commitment to sustain-\nability by meeting the highest performance standards.\nCommitted to Our\nCore Values\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n17\nCommitted to Our Core Values\nCommitted to the \nCommunities We Serve\n2010 Corporate Giving\nFannie Mae's Oﬃce of Community and Charitable Giving\nprovides grant investments to nonproﬁt organizations \nthat help struggling borrowers avoid foreclosure; work to\nstabilize neighborhoods by acquiring, rehabilitating, and \nreselling foreclosed properties; provide aﬀordable rental\nhousing; strive to prevent and end homelessness; and \ncreate strong neighborhoods. Last year, Fannie Mae’s \nsupport helped our grant partners:\nI Provide foreclosure prevention information and \ncounseling to more than 370,000 at-risk families \nnationwide, assisting more than 104,000 families \navoid foreclosure.\nI Acquire more than 10,000 foreclosed properties to \nhelp stabilize neighborhoods hard hit by foreclosures.\nI Preserve more than 4,000 aﬀordable for-sale or rental\nunits nationwide.\nI Develop and complete more than 9,000 units of \npermanent supportive housing.\nI Produce more than 2,000 units of aﬀordable for-sale or\nrental housing.\nHabitat for Humanity International\nIn 2010, Fannie Mae provided a grant to Habitat for\nHumanity International for its Neighborhood Revital-\nization Initiative. The grant will be used to help Habitat\naﬃliates across the country acquire properties —\nsome of them foreclosed — rehabilitate them, and \nresell them to low-income families.\nThe grant will also help develop and deliver training and\ntechnical assistance to Habitat aﬃliates and enhance\ntheir best practices under mortgage lending laws.\nNearly 130,000 people participated in the 2010 Help the Homeless Program.\nHelp the Homeless\nHomelessness is a chronic problem in the Washington, DC\nmetropolitan area. Among the homeless population, one\nout of four is a child. \nFannie Mae’s Help the Homeless Program (HTH) is a public\nawareness program that raises funds to support nonproﬁt\norganizations working to prevent and end homelessness \nin our nation’s capital. The initiative also encourages volun-\nteerism in service to the homeless and those at risk of \nbecoming homeless.\nFannie Mae employees started the program in 1988 with a\nmodest walk. Since that time, HTH has grown extensively\nand, in 2010, included a Walkathon on the National Mall \nand 715 community Mini-Walks in the DC metro area. Over-\nall, nearly 130,000 people participated last year, raising\n$6.5 million.\nThe HTH Program focuses on the homeless in our commu-\nnity by supporting a “continuum of care,” whereby service\nproviders that oﬀer permanent aﬀordable housing, perma-\nnent supportive housing, transitional housing, prevention\nand rapid re-housing, social services, and emergency \nshelters are selected to become HTH beneﬁciaries.\nAll six of these focus areas align the program with Fannie\nMae’s corporate priorities of providing stability and aﬀord-\nability to the U.S. housing market by directly supporting\nforeclosure prevention and aﬀordable housing. The agen-\ncies in the HTH Program help more than 400,000 clients,\noﬀering more than 6,200 housing units to the Washington,\nDC metro area.\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n18\nCommitted to Our Core Values\nEmployee Volunteer Proﬁle\nRansom Miller embodies the spirit of service that \nFannie Mae employees demonstrate every day in \ncommunities across the country. \nIn 1995, Miller, who works in Fannie Mae’s corporate \ntax division, founded Project GiveBack — a small \nWashington, DC nonproﬁt with a simple mission to \nprovide families with food at Thanksgiving. He collected\n$500 in donations from friends and colleagues that \nﬁrst year, bought enough food to feed six families for a\nweek, and delivered it the Saturday before Thanksgiving.\nInspired by this early success, he made plans to \nexpand the eﬀort. He never imagined how much it\nwould grow. \nOn the Saturday before Thanksgiving 2010, Miller was\nup before sunrise sorting through piles of turkeys, \nchickens, ﬁsh ﬁllets, sausages, beef patties, stuﬃng,\nand sweet potatoes at the Bell Multicultural High\nSchool. He and approximately 500 volunteers busily\npacked boxes of food to distribute later that day to 1,000\nfamilies across the Washington metropolitan area. \nOver the past 16 years, Miller has raised more than\n$230,000 for Project GiveBack and fed more than\n4,200 families.  \nThis year, Miller plans to recruit volunteers from the\nFannie Mae Dallas and Chicago oﬃces, Baltimore, \nOklahoma City, and Houston and show them how to \norganize Thanksgiving food drives in their cities. “I \nthink there’s a real need for programs like this across\nthe country, especially in this economy,” said Miller. “I’d\nlove to help make it happen.”\nFannie Mae employee Ransom Miller has served over 4,200 families\nin the Washington, DC area through Project GiveBack, a public-\nservice nonproﬁt he started in 1995.\nOne hundred percent of registration fees, sponsorships,\nand donations to HTH go directly to nonproﬁt beneﬁciary\norganizations dedicated to assisting the homeless. The\nHTH Program does not use any of those monies to under-\nwrite its eﬀorts. In a recent poll conducted among past \nparticipants, the practice of having 100 percent of all\nwalker registration fees and donations going directly to the\nnonproﬁts was a top driver for participation, second to\nhelping homeless children.\nEmployee Volunteerism and Giving\nThrough Fannie Mae's SERVE employee volunteer and \ngiving program (Serving, Engaged, Ready to Volunteer \nEmployees), approximately 54 percent of our employee\nworkforce gave over 69,000 volunteer hours in 2010. Their\neﬀorts beneﬁted nearly 1,000 nonproﬁt organizations,\nschools, and community groups in our company's head-\nquarters of Washington, DC, and across the country. In \naddition, Fannie Mae employees donated more than \n$1.2 million to nonproﬁts in 2010.\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n19\n \nIn 2011, we expect the U.S. economy to move from a fragile\nrecovery to a steadier expansion, as well as slightly\nstronger growth in housing activity. But given the many\nvariables, our optimism remains tempered. Many families\ncontinue to struggle. The housing market continues to \nwork through a backlog in inventory. And housing prices \nremain uneven.\nWhile Fannie Mae made important progress in 2010, we\nhave much more work to do to help the U.S. housing market\nget back on track. In addition to providing liquidity and help-\ning distressed families, we will continue our eﬀorts to build\na better foundation for housing in the future — one based\non stronger lending standards, a common-sense deﬁnition\nof what constitutes appropriate risk, and quality aﬀordable\nhome and rental options.\nWe will continue to strengthen our company so we can \nbetter serve the housing market, deliver on our mission,\nand create value for taxpayers.\nLooking Ahead\nFannie Mae Mission Report\n20\nIntroduction\n3900 Wisconsin Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC 20016-2892\nPhone (202) 752-7000 \nwww.fanniemae.com"

These actions have \nenabled Fannie Mae to help millions of Americans buy, refinance and rent affordable \nhousing in the midst of the worst housing downturn since the Great Depression. \nWorking with our partners, we also helped borrowers avoid losing their homes to \nforeclosure and helped stabilize neighborhoods hurt by the housing crisis. These \nefforts are essential to bring about recovery in the housing market. \nWe take our mission and mandate very seriously. Our 6,000-plus employees are \nfocused on – and motivated by – the work we do to help struggling families and \ncommunities. \nGiven the government’s unprecedented support for Fannie Mae, we feel it is \nappropriate to describe our efforts to support the market. This report covers our \nactivities in 2009. \nOur efforts will continue as we work with our housing partners and the government \nto restore the health of America’s housing market. \nPhil Laskawy\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMike Williams \n \nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   2\nHelping Housing Recover\nA report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance\nMarch 2010\nThe government has provided significant financial assistance to the GSEs under \nconservatorship, underscoring the critical role we play in the recovery of the housing \nmarket and the economy as a whole. Through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the \nFederal Housing Administration, families are able to get new mortgages, refinance \nexisting mortgages or obtain affordable rental housing.\nAs other sources of liquidity have left the market, Fannie Mae has continued to \nbuy or securitize mortgage loans originated by credit unions, community banks, \ncommercial banks and other institutions. Many of these loans are packaged into \nmortgage-backed securities (MBS) and sold to investors. \nThe U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve purchased our MBS to keep single-\nfamily mortgage rates affordable and help stabilize the housing market, resulting in \ninterest rates for single-family loans at about 5 percent or below, among the lowest \nin history. \nMortgage rates for multifamily loans, about 6 percent or below for 10-year loans \nduring 2009, have also remained steady during the downturn through the stabilizing \nimpact of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This has helped assure adequate debt \nfinancing for rental housing.\nIn addition to providing financial support, the government has mandated that\nFannie Mae not only continue our day-to-day activities in support of the market, but \nalso undertake extraordinary efforts to help bring about a housing recovery.\nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   3\nSupport for Markets \nFannie Mae provided $823.6 billion in funding, or “liquidity,” to keep the single-\nfamily and multifamily mortgage markets operating during 2009. Fannie Mae was \nresponsible for more than 40 percent of the mortgage-related securities issuances, \nwhich made funds available for people to buy and refinance homes. We also \nprovided over 40 percent of financing for rental housing. \nThrough this funding, Fannie Mae provided financing that helped: \n• 600,000 borrowers buy homes during the tightest mortgage credit market  \nin decades, \n• 2.5 million borrowers refinance into loans with lower payments, better terms or to \nmeet other needs, and many borrowers were able to refinance despite having lost \nequity, and\n• Purchase, refinance or rehabilitate 372,000 rental units. \nIn addition, more than 160,000 borrowers with Fannie Mae-owned loans were able \nto keep their homes through loan modification or other loan assistance.\nSupport for Making Home Affordable \nIn February 2009, the Administration announced the Making Home Affordable \nProgram – the most aggressive housing relief effort in decades – and gave \nFannie Mae two distinct and central roles in the program:\n• Loan modification: The U.S. Treasury appointed Fannie Mae as its agent to \nadminister the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). This program \nhelps struggling borrowers – those whose loans are owned or securitized by \nFannie Mae or Freddie Mac and those financed by other institutions – to modify \ntheir loans and avoid losing their homes to foreclosure.\n• Loan refinancing: Under the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), \nwhich is available to borrowers with GSE-owned or guaranteed loans, Fannie \nMae offers many of our borrowers the opportunity to refinance into better loans, \neven if the value of their homes has declined to the point where they owe more \nthan their homes are worth. Such low or negative equity normally is a barrier to \nrefinancing. \nServing \nHomeownership\nIn 2009, Fannie Mae provided:\n$823.6 billion\nin mortgage market \nliquidity\nMortgage funding for\n3.1 million \nborrowers\n40 percent\nof mortgage-related \nsecurities to fund \nhome purchases and \nrefinances\nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   4\nI. Liquidity to Keep Financing Flowing \nInvestor capital is essential to a functioning mortgage market. As home prices, \nhome sales, housing starts and mortgage originations fell sharply during the \nhousing downturn, many mortgage investors left the market. \nTo help us support the market, Fannie Mae receives assistance from the U.S. \ngovernment in three ways: \n• Funding commitment from the U.S. Treasury to support our net worth,\n• U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve programs to purchase GSE debt and MBS, and \n• Availability of a U.S. Treasury credit facility (which was never used). \nThe purchase programs are set to be completed by March 31, 2010, and the\ncredit facility expired on December 31, 2009. (The funding commitment from the \nU.S. Treasury does not expire.)\nWith this infusion of financial support, Fannie Mae has been able to provide \nmortgage lenders with funds to lend to homebuyers, refinance loans and finance \nmultifamily housing at affordable rates. \nFannie Mae financing reaches the market through our three complementary \nbusinesses: Single-Family Mortgage Business, Housing and Community Development \n(Multifamily) and Capital Markets. Single-Family and Multifamily acquire mortgage \nloans from lenders and, in most cases, package them into Fannie Mae MBS. \nStamped with our credit guaranty, the MBS become more marketable and thus \nsupport lower interest rates. Capital Markets serves as the interface between \nFannie Mae and the open markets by issuing debt securities that are purchased by \ninvestors, which raises capital to fund housing and mortgage markets.\nFinancing for Homebuyers and Homeowners \nFannie Mae’s role as a consistent provider of liquidity to the single-family mortgage \nmarket has contributed to a lower mortgage rate for 30-year fixed-rate conforming \nmortgages relative to “jumbo” mortgage loans (loans above our current $417,000 \nlimit in most markets). During 2009, millions of borrowers took advantage of the \nlowest rates in 50 years to buy and refinance homes. As previously noted:\n• Fannie Mae worked with more than 1,000 lender partners – customers large and \nsmall – to provide financing for 600,000 borrowers to buy homes and for \n2.5 million homeowners to refinance their loans. \n• Fannie Mae introduced “Refi Plus,” a streamlined refinancing process, in April \n2009, which served 329,000 of our borrowers. \nLiquidity Results\nWith Fannie Mae financing\nin 2009:\n600,000\nborrowers bought \nhomes\n2.5 million\nborrowers refinanced\n329,000\nFannie Mae borrowers \nused streamlined \nrefinancing\nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   5\nSupport for Housing Finance Agencies\nState and local housing finance agencies (HFAs) are one of the largest sources \nof affordable lending for working families to buy homes and to build and preserve \naffordable rental housing. Over the years, HFAs have served more than six million \nfamilies. The agencies finance their lending primarily by issuing housing bonds for \nsale to investors. The financial crisis, however, disrupted HFAs’ access to investor \ncapital, restricting their efforts.\nIn October 2009, the U.S. Treasury launched an initiative to return liquidity to the \nHFAs. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were asked to design and implement the HFA \nInitiative by the end of 2009. Fannie Mae’s long-standing partnership with HFAs \nenabled us to move quickly, mobilizing specialists from across the company to \nlaunch the $23.5 billion initiative in just 70 days. As a result:\n• HFAs can access $15.3 billion in new tax-exempt capital available through U.S. \nTreasury purchases, and leverage an additional $7.7 billion.\n• HFAs can stabilize their balance sheets using $8.2 billion in new temporary credit \nand liquidity facilities.\nWith funding provided through the HFA Initiative, HFAs are expected to help more \nthan 200,000 households buy or rent affordable homes. Lending by HFAs in 2010 \ncould equal the peak years of 2006 and 2007. Fannie Mae also provided the HFAs \nwith access to $958 million for single-family lending in 2009 above and beyond the \nHFA Initiative. We also developed single-family affordable lending options tailored \nfor HFAs. \nFinancing for Multifamily Rental Housing\nAs the multifamily rental market faced a challenging year in 2009, Fannie Mae \nremained the primary source of liquidity for multifamily borrowers. \n• We were responsible for over 40 percent of financing in the multifamily market — \nmore than any other private or government-sponsored enterprise. More than 80 \npercent of this financing came through packaging and securitizing loans into MBS. \n• We provided $19.8 billion in permanent financing for the purchase, refinance or \nrehabilitation of approximately 372,000 rental units. Of those, 87 percent were \naffordable units for low- and moderate-income families. \nFannie Mae helps stabilize multifamily interest rates as a consistent and reliable \nsource of financing, which helps to create affordable rental housing even in \nchallenging times.\nHelp for Smaller Lenders\nThe credit crunch has hit small and mid-sized lenders especially hard. Lines of credit \nhave dried up and investors interested in buying loans are hard to find. Lack of \ncredit leaves many lenders without funds to continue making loans to homebuyers.\nFannie Mae’s Capital Markets group offers options to smaller lenders to bolster their \ncash flow:\n• We buy a lender’s whole loans, principally for the purpose of securitizing them. \nWe securitized about $83 billion in loans bought for cash in 2009. \n• We speed up access to funds so a lender receives quicker payment for loans \nexchanged for Fannie Mae MBS. Our early funding totaled $103 billion in 2009.\nHFA\nBond Initiative\nProvides housing \nfinance agencies with \naccess to\n$23.5 billion\nto help\n200,000\nfamilies buy or rent \naffordable homes\nHelp for\nSmaller Lenders\n$83 billion\nin whole loans bought \nand securitized\n$103 billion\nin early funding\nMultifamily \nRental Housing\n$19.8 billion\nin Fannie Mae \nfinancing in 2009 \n372,000\nrental units bought, \nrefinanced or \nrehabilitated\n87 percent\nwere affordable units\nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   6\nII. Stability for Homeowners and Communities\nThe economic downturn that hurt families and communities all over the country \naffected Fannie Mae borrowers as well. We own or guarantee 18 million mortgages, \nabout one in every four in America. About 5 percent of our borrowers were three \nmonths or more behind in their payments as of December 31, 2009. While our rate \nof serious delinquency is lower than the market as a whole, which is facing a serious \ndelinquency rate of 10 percent, every default creates pain for the borrower and a \nfinancial loss for us. \nWe work to help struggling families stay in their homes and avoid foreclosure, which \nreduces our credit losses and reduces the burden on the taxpayers who now fund \nour enterprise. Making Home Affordable (MHA) offers important tools: HAMP, the \nmodification program, and HARP, which provides access to refinancing.\nFor borrowers unable to stay in their homes, we also offer options that help \nhomeowners make a smooth transition to other housing.\nHelping Troubled Borrowers \nUnder the HAMP loan modification initiative, all loans owned or guaranteed by \nFannie Mae or Freddie Mac – as well as non-GSE loans handled by more than 100 \nmortgage servicers participating in the program – must be evaluated to see if they \nare eligible for HAMP workouts before a foreclosure sale can occur.\nThe U.S. Treasury has reported that 902,000 borrowers started HAMP trial \nmodifications in 2009. About 330,000 were Fannie Mae borrowers. Borrowers must \nsuccessfully make modified payments for a trial period of at least three months \nbefore a permanent modification takes effect. According to the U.S. Treasury, about \n66,000 borrowers received permanent loan modifications. The median savings for \nthe borrowers was more than $500 per month.\nWhen a borrower with a Fannie Mae-owned loan does not qualify for HAMP, we offer \nother workout options through our servicers. In 2009, Fannie Mae provided more \nthan 75,000 of our borrowers with non-HAMP modifications and helped another \n62,000 borrowers keep their homes through repayment plans, payment forbearance \nor an unsecured personal loan used to bring the mortgage loan current. \nStability Results\nModifications \nin 2009\t\n902,000\nborrowers entered \nHAMP trial \nmodifications\n330,000\nwere Fannie Mae \nborrowers\n66,000\nborrowers received \npermanent HAMP \nmodifications\n$500\nMedian monthly \npayment reduction\nMore than\n75,000\nFannie Mae borrowers \nreceived modifications \noutside HAMP\nOther Assistance\n62,000\nFannie Mae borrowers \nreceived repayment \nplans, unsecured \npersonal loans or \nloan forbearance\nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   7\nSpecial Refinancing\nOf the 2.5 million borrowers who refinanced their mortgages with Fannie Mae \nfinancing in 2009, 329,000 refinanced through our streamlined process, including \n104,000 Fannie Mae borrowers who refinanced through HARP. HARP borrowers, \nwho had low or negative equity, reduced their payments by an average of $155 per \nmonth and a combined annual total of $190 million in mortgage payments. They also \nbenefited from reduced mortgage insurance requirements.\nWe created an online loan look-up tool where borrowers can find out if Fannie Mae \nowns their loan, a key step in determining eligibility for HARP. About six million \nborrowers used the tool in 2009, which is available on fanniemae.com. \nOther Options for Fannie Mae Borrowers \nAs more borrowers face longer-term economic hardships and negative home equity, \nthere is a growing need for foreclosure alternatives for borrowers who cannot keep \ntheir homes. Fannie Mae offers our borrowers options that can help them avoid the \nforeclosure process even if they must give up their homes. In 2009, about 40,000 \nborrowers took advantage of these options:\n• Deed-for-Lease, introduced by Fannie Mae in 2009, gives borrowers who voluntarily \nturn over the deed to their home the opportunity to rent that home for up to \n12 months. This allows families to complete the school year and plan for other \nhousing.\n• Deed-in-lieu of foreclosure offers borrowers the opportunity to voluntarily convey \nthe property to Fannie Mae and avoid the negative impact on their credit that \nwould result from a foreclosure.\n• Pre-foreclosure or “short” sale is an option for borrowers who must sell their \nhome and owe more than the home is worth. Servicers may elect to settle the \nmortgage debt for a lesser amount. This can reduce the impact of foreclosure on \nthe borrower’s credit and financial situation. \nWe continue to work on tools to ease the departure for borrowers when there are no \nother options to retain the property. \nForeclosure \nAlternatives\n40,000\nFannie Mae borrowers \navoided foreclosure \nthrough short sales, \ndeeds-in-lieu of \nforeclosure or \ndeeds-for-lease\nRefinances\nUnder HARP in 2009:\n104,000\nFannie Mae borrowers \nrefinanced despite \nlow or negative equity\n$190 million\nTotal annual amount \nsaved by Fannie Mae \nborrowers\n$155\nAverage monthly \npayment reduction\n6 million\nborrowers used online \nloan look-up tool\nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   8\nAdministering Home Affordable Modification Program\nWhen the U.S. Treasury appointed Fannie Mae to administer HAMP, it gave us \nresponsibility to help educate borrowers about the program, train and support \nservicers who modify the loans and provide reliable systems support and payment \nprocessing. \nFannie Mae supported the U.S. Treasury’s campaign to reach struggling borrowers \nin 2009. We visited 20 cities hit hard by foreclosures, part of a 40-city effort that \ncontinues through 2010. On Treasury’s behalf, we held foreclosure prevention \nworkshops where borrowers could meet with mortgage servicers and/or housing \ncounselors approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(HUD) to learn about loan modification and other options to avoid foreclosure. \nMore than 130,000 borrowers called the Fannie Mae Call Center with questions \nabout MHA in 2009. To address the need for borrower information, we supported the \nU.S. Treasury’s partnership with the Homeowner’s HOPE Hotline. Through the Hotline, \nborrowers can determine their basic eligibility for Making Home Affordable Program \nassistance and receive free HUD-approved housing counseling. That number is \n888-995-HOPE.\nFannie Mae employees have volunteered to support borrower outreach efforts. Over \n1,000 employees volunteered days, nights and weekends at foreclosure prevention \nworkshops or talked with distressed borrowers who called the Call Center. Members \nof our Hispanic Employee Resource Group helped Spanish-speaking borrowers. \nThis was part of Fannie Mae’s overall volunteer effort in 2009, when nearly 2,500 \nemployees volunteered almost 33,000 hours to help nearly 300 organizations and \nschools in their communities.\nWhile implementing a program of the unprecedented breadth of HAMP has been \nchallenging, the number of homeowners receiving payment relief and converting \nfrom trial to permanent modifications continues to rise. \nInitially, many mortgage servicers lacked the capacity to modify large numbers \nof mortgages and to make trial modifications permanent. Many borrowers were \nnot able to fulfill the modification terms in the trial stage or deliver the financial \ndocuments needed to complete the process. The U.S. Treasury provided guidance, \nimplemented by Fannie Mae, to address these issues, which has included:\n• Streamlining documentation requirements and providing temporary extensions \ngiving borrowers more time to complete and submit documents,\n• Sending Fannie Mae loan specialists to work alongside mortgage servicers to \nexpedite modifications, and \n• Giving servicers rapid assistance through a dedicated Web site, a servicer call \ncenter and a variety of training opportunities. \nMaking Home \nAffordable\nWith Fannie Mae support \nin 2009:\n20 cities\nvisited to reach \nstruggling borrowers\n130,000\nborrowers contacted \nFannie Mae Call Center\nFannie Mae \nVolunteers\n33,000\nvolunteer hours in 2009\n2,500\nemployees gave time \nand talent\n300\norganizations and \nschools were assisted\n1,000\nvolunteered to help \nwith foreclosure \nprevention efforts\nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   9\nMaintaining Neighborhood Stability\nForeclosure prevention efforts are having an impact, yet some foreclosures are \nunavoidable. Fannie Mae seeks to stabilize neighborhoods by keeping the homes \nwe acquire after foreclosure in good condition and putting them back into service as \nrapidly as possible. In 2009, we invested $182 million to make significant repairs to \nnearly 38,000 properties and another $267 million to maintain properties. We sold \nmore than 120,000 homes, including 82,000 to owner-occupants in 2009.\nWe have taken a variety of steps to put our properties back in use, including: \n• Launching HomePath.com where visitors can search more than 56,000 properties \nby zip code and learn about special financing. The site is also available in Spanish.\n• Creating “First Look,” a Fannie Mae initiative that offers an advantage to owner-\noccupants, public entities and nonprofit buyers who seek to purchase our \nproperties. During the first 15 days a property is listed, we only consider offers \nfrom buyers who will use the homes as their primary residence or those who will \nuse public programs to buy them. We consider offers from investors only after \nthose initial 15 days. \nNew Life for Foreclosed Homes\nOne option for getting foreclosed homes back into productive use is to turn them \ninto affordable housing. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), created by \nHUD, is a major funding source and ambitious effort to help public entities, nonprofits \nand other purchasers rehab and resell foreclosed properties and to provide down \npayment assistance to homebuyers. NSP grants totaling $6 billion are making that \nhappen. \nLast year, Fannie Mae sold over 1,000 foreclosed homes to NSP and other publicly \nfunded buyers. For example:\n• The City of Milwaukee used NSP funds to purchase properties and provide \nhomebuyers with down payment assistance to buy Fannie Mae homes in targeted \nneighborhoods. \n• In Minneapolis/St. Paul, a multi-agency housing collaborative used NSP and other \nfunds to buy and rehabilitate 68 Fannie Mae homes for resale to homeowners. \n• In Cleveland, the Cuyahoga County Land Bank used NSP funds to buy 25 \nFannie Mae homes. Twenty-four will be demolished to reduce the inventory of \nexcess housing in the county. Fannie Mae contributed $3,500 per unit towards \ndemolition costs.\nPutting \nForeclosed Homes \nto Work in 2009\n$449 million\nspent to repair and \nmaintain properties\n120,000\nforeclosed homes sold\n82,000\nforeclosed homes sold \nto owner-occupants\n56,000\nproperties listed on \nHomePath.com\n1,000\nhomes sold to buyers \nusing NSP and other \npublic funds\nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   10\nProtecting Tenants Affected by Foreclosure \nWhen Fannie Mae acquires foreclosed homes used as rental properties, we try to \nease the impact on tenants living in the homes as we prepare the homes for sale. \nGoing beyond the requirements of the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act of 2009, \nwe offer eligible tenants the option of signing a new 12-month lease with Fannie Mae \nas well as relocation assistance at the end of the lease. \nWarning Homeowners About Foreclosure Scams\nScam artists prey on vulnerable borrowers with phony foreclosure “rescue” offers. \nFannie Mae is teaming with NeighborWorks America, other non-profits, government \nagencies, Freddie Mac and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law to \nprovide borrowers with information on how to recognize and report fraud through the \nLoanScamAlert.org and PreventLoanScams.org Web sites.\nWhen Natural Disaster Threatens Stability \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita ravaged the Gulf Coast five years ago, their winds and \nwater leaving nearly 300,000 homes unlivable, destroying much of the region’s \nhousing infrastructure. The local economy came to a virtual halt, and investment \ncapital threatened to disappear from the housing market. In effect, nobody wanted to \nfinance homes in the region. \nFannie Mae’s mission to ensure funding under all economic conditions can be vital \nwhen catastrophic disaster strikes. After hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the \nregion, Fannie Mae kept mortgage funds and affordable housing investment capital \nflowing to the communities. We also worked with our disaster partners, including the \nAmerican Red Cross, to help stabilize neighborhoods and communities via grant and \nvolunteer assistance.\nSince 2005, we have provided more than $60 billion in financing for single-family \nmortgage loans and more than $4 billion in financing for multifamily rental apartments \nin the Gulf Coast. Five years later, Fannie Mae continues to be one of the largest \nsources of mortgage financing in the region. \nDisaster Response\nSince the hurricanes of 2005, \nFannie Mae has supported Gulf \nCoast rebuilding with:\n$60 billion\nin financing for \nhomebuyers and \nhomeowners\n$4 billion\nin financing for \nrental apartments\nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   11\nFannie Mae’s responsibility is to provide financing that helps make it possible for \nAmericans to buy or rent decent, affordable housing. In 2009, Fannie Mae supported \nlending that served more than 1.7 million low- and moderate-income families, more \nthan one million families living in underserved communities and nearly 760,000 very \nlow-income households. In accordance with our statutory housing goals, some loans \nwere counted in more than one of these categories. \nWe also provided affordable financing for specific housing needs, which helped make \nhomebuying or refinancing possible for:\n• 232,000 families in rural counties,\n• 182,000 first-time buyers earning low- to moderate-incomes; including \nmodifications that helped these buyers retain their homes, \n• 6,500 buyers of manufactured homes. After HUD, Fannie Mae is one of the \nlargest investors in loans for manufactured homes backed by real estate, and\n• 1,400 Native Americans purchasing homes on tribal lands. Fannie Mae is \nvirtually the only source of secondary financing for these loans, outside of HUD. \nA team of Fannie Mae lending specialists focuses on housing opportunities for this \ncommunity.\nEighty-seven percent of our multifamily rental housing financing served low- and \nmoderate-income renters. Our financing supported production, preservation or \nrehabilitation of:\n• 31,000 units of rent-restricted housing for people earning 60 percent or less of \narea median income,\n• 19,000 affordable rental apartments that might otherwise have been demolished \nor converted to market-rate rentals, \n• 11,000 rental apartments specifically designed for senior citizens, and\n• 1,700 units of public housing for families earning less than 30 percent of area \nmedian income.\nPreserving Rental Affordability\nHUD’s Section 8 housing program provides rental subsidies that help more than \n1.4 million very low-income households afford privately owned rental housing. When \nSection 8 housing contracts expire, property owners can elect to raise rents to \nmarket rates. As part of our commitment to preserve affordable housing and in \nsupport of our government mandate, Fannie Mae is a significant source of financing \nto preserve Section 8 housing.\nIII. A Focus on Affordability \nAffordability \nResults\nIn 2009, Fannie Mae provided \naffordable financing that served:\n1.7 million\nlow- and moderate- \nincome families \n1.1 million\nfamilies in \nunderserved areas\n760,000\nvery low-income \nfamilies\n232,000\nfamilies in rural \ncounties\n182,000\nfirst-time buyers\n6,500\nfamilies to buy \nor refinance \nmanufactured homes\nAffordable Rentals\t\n31,000\nrent-restricted units\nPreservation of\n19,000\napartments \nHousing for\n11,000 seniors \nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   12\nAffordable Housing Goals\nFannie Mae is required to meet affordable housing goals established for the \nGSEs by our regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In 2009, \nthe goals focused on affordable lending for (1) low- and moderate-income families, \n(2) underserved areas, including certain urban neighborhoods and rural areas, and \n(3) low-income families living in low-income areas and very low-income families, \na goal defined as “special affordable housing.” These goals also included subgoals.\nFHFA recently proposed new affordable housing goals for 2010. Three single-family \npurchase money goals will cover mortgages affordable to low-income and very low-\nincome families and families in low-income areas. Other goals address single-family \nlow-income refinance mortgages and mortgages that finance multifamily housing \nunits affordable to low-income and very low-income families. The single-family goals \nwill be percentage of business goals. The multifamily goals will be measured in units. \nNew “Duty to Serve” Requirements\nIn addition to affordable housing goals, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act \nof 2008 requires the GSEs to provide market leadership in three specific areas – \naffordable housing preservation, manufactured housing and rural areas, effective in \n2010. Known as the “Duty to Serve Underserved Markets,” these are distinct from \nthe affordable housing goals noted above. \nSupporting Sustainable Homeownership\nOne of the lessons learned from the housing crisis is that putting people in homes \nthey cannot afford for the long term hurts the homeowner, the community and the \nhousing market as a whole. \nIn that light, Fannie Mae strengthened our underwriting standards in 2009 to help \nensure that homeownership is successful and sustainable. We now require higher \ncredit scores and a lower proportion of overall household debt.\nWhile these stronger standards may mean that some aspiring homeowners are \nunable to obtain a Fannie Mae-backed mortgage right now, the company is striving \nto ensure that their path to sustainable homeownership is clear. We are joining with \nhousing and personal finance counselors to provide homebuyers with information \nabout successful homeownership. Fannie Mae offers free, Web-based information \nfor housing counselors, lenders and mortgage brokers to help them help consumers \nunderstand and prepare for the mortgage loan process.\nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   13\nFinding Solutions to Homelessness\nFor those who are homeless or risk losing their home, the economic crisis has been \ndevastating. More families are facing financial hardship because of lost wages and \nother challenges, and sources of funding for much-needed affordable and supportive \nhousing are becoming harder to find.\nFannie Mae has worked for many years to fund the development of permanent \nsupportive housing and help end homelessness through our investments and \nfundraising. \n• In 2009, the Jericho Project, a New York-based nonprofit that provides housing \nand supportive services for formerly homeless men and women, proceeded with \nconstruction of 132 housing units for homeless and low-income veterans and \ntheir families in the Bronx. The Jericho Project received financing through the \nNew York City Acquisition Fund, in which Fannie Mae has a $20 million, multi-year \ncommitment to help provide financing for supportive housing.\n• Fannie Mae’s 22nd Annual Help the Homeless campaign, the nation’s largest \nfundraising effort focused on homelessness, raised $5.8 million in 2009 for 134 \nhomeless service providers in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. More than \n117,000 people supported the effort by joining the Help the Homeless Walkathon \non the National Mall and taking part in 657 community “mini-walks.”\nFannie Mae’s\n22nd Annual \nHelp the \nHomeless \nProgram\n$5.8 million\nraised in 2009\n117,000\nsupporters and \nparticipants\nProceeds helped\n134 \nhomeless service \nproviders in \nWashington, DC area\nHelping Housing Recover: A report on Fannie Mae’s mission performance   14\nIV. Looking Ahead\nAs of this report, glimmers of recovery have begun to appear in the housing market. \nBut most observers -- including Fannie Mae’s economics team -- caution that the \nmarket has a long way to go before it reaches stability. Millions of homeowners are \nbehind on their mortgage payments and struggling to keep their homes. Funding is \ntight for rental housing construction and rehabilitation. Housing inventories remain \nhigh. Home prices continue to seek equilibrium. \nAll of this means Fannie Mae has a lot of work to do to help put housing back on \ntrack. Our priorities for 2010 include helping homeowners keep their homes, putting \nempty homes back into service to stabilize neighborhoods, providing funds so that \nhomeowners can refinance into better loans and helping mortgage lenders offer \nborrowers the financing they need to become homeowners. \nWe appreciate the government’s support for our mission to provide liquidity, stability \nand affordability to the U.S. housing finance system, and we are committed to \ngetting the job done.\n3900 Wisconsin Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC 20016-2892\n© 2010, Fannie Mae\nw w w . f a n n i e m a e . c o m"
