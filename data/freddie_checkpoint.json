Since being chartered by Congress in 1970, we have fulfilled our mission to keep mortgage money flowing, support the stability of the housing market, and promote housing affordability. And we continue to lead the housing industry forward, building a better housing finance system – for today and for tomorrow.\nFreddie Mac operates in the U.S. secondary mortgage market. That means we don’t lend directly to borrowers but buy loans that meet our standards from approved lenders. With the money that lenders receive in return, they can make loans to other qualified borrowers. In securitizing pools of mortgages and selling the securities to investors, we shift a significant portion of the credit risk associated with the loans we own to private investors.\nWe conduct business through two business segments, the single-family business segment and the multifamily business segment. Those two segments are primarily supported by our Single-Family Division, Multifamily Division and Capital Markets Division.\nOur single-family business segment supports responsible, sustainable homeownership.\nOur single-family business segment supports responsible, sustainable homeownership. We do so primarily through the work of ourSingle-Family DivisionandCapital Markets Division.\nThose divisions work with lenders of all sizes – national, regional, and community lenders and credit unions – to buy conventional, conforming mortgage loans for one- to four-unit homes – including condominiums and manufactured homes – up to a certain dollar amount set by our regulator. As part of our mission, we are committed to creating homeownership opportunities for people hoping to buy a home for the first time, earning low and moderate incomes, and living in underserved markets.\nBecause lenders know they can sell loans to us, they are more willing to make long-term, fixed-rate loans, which make mortgage payments more affordable to more households. When a homeowner faces financial difficulties, we work with the lender to help the borrower avoid foreclosure, where possible, or exit homeownership as smoothly as possible.\nWe also promote liquidity and make funding more available to borrowers by purchasing mortgage-related securities guaranteed by Freddie Mac and other financial institutions as investments. We fund these investments by issuing corporate debt securities. Freddie Mac’s investors include but are not limited to central and commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies, and securities dealers from around the world.\nOur multifamily business segment supports affordable rental opportunities across the nation.\nOur multifamily business segment supports affordable rental opportunities across the nation, primarily through the work of ourMultifamily Divisionand capital markets activities within that group and theCapital Markets Division.\nWorking with a network of specialized lenders, Freddie Mac provides funding for loans on properties ranging from five units to hundreds of units across multiple buildings. We support all types of multifamily properties nationwide, including conventional, seniors, student, and subsidized housing as well as smaller properties and manufactured housing communities.\nOur funding is vital to making sure that renters have access to adequate, affordable apartment homes. Around 90 percent of the apartments we finance each year are affordable to low- or moderate-income renters. Multifamily borrowers mainly are commercial entities, such as property developers, and the properties are considered businesses. Our in-house teams closely oversee loan and property quality throughout the life of each loan.\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nMedia Room\nInvestor Relations\nCareers\nOur Suppliers\nOur Business\nSingle-Family Division\nMultifamily Division\nCapital Markets Division\nResources\nMortgage Lookup Tool\nRental Lookup Tool\nMy Home by Freddie Mac®\nCreditSmart®\nConnect With Us\nContact Us\nReport a Security or Privacy Incident\nSign up for news, tips, and insights"

Box 43078Providence, RI 02940-3078United States of America\nWebsite:https://www-us.computershare.com/investor\nUnder Freddie Mac's Congressional charter, the corporation's official name is Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. However, the Board of Directors has authorized the corporation to conduct business as Freddie Mac.\nFreddie Mac is a federally chartered corporation created by Congress on July 24, 1970.\nThe company's corporate headquarters is located in McLean, VA. Freddie Mac also operates five regional offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York.\nOn January 3, 1989, Freddie Mac stock was converted into a class of stock that could be owned and traded by all investors. (Prior to that date, ownership of the stock was limited by its terms to financial institutions and a small number of other parties.) On August 9, 1989, Congress amended Freddie Mac's charter to convert this class of stock into Voting Common Stock, granting its holders the right to elect 13 directors of the Company. The Voting Common Stock and its predecessors were listed on the New York Stock Exchange from 1984 through July 7, 2010, and began trading exclusively on the over-the-counter (OTC) market since July 8, 2010.\nBeginning on July 8, 2010, Freddie Mac common stock is exclusively traded on the OTC market.\nThe ticker symbol is FMCC.\nNo. Freddie Mac was chartered by Congress as a private company serving a public purpose. On September 6, 2008, the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), appointed FHFA as conservator of Freddie Mac. As conservator, FHFA has all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of Freddie Mac, and of any stockholder, officer, or director of Freddie Mac with respect to Freddie Mac and its assets; and title to the books, records and assets of Freddie Mac. In connection with the appointment of FHFA as conservator, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have entered into a Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement. As part of the agreement, Freddie Mac has issued senior preferred stock to Treasury, together with a warrant for the purchase of common stock representing 79.9% of Freddie Mac’s common stock.\nFreddie Mac ’s regulator is theFederal Housing Finance Agency(FHFA).  FHFA was established in 2008 as an independent government agency responsible for oversight of the operations of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Banks. In addition, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has fair housing authority over Freddie Mac.\nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae have substantially similar charters, Congressional mandates, and regulatory structures. Both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are publicly traded corporations. Ginnie Mae is a government-owned corporation within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that guarantees mortgage-backed securities backed by federally insured or guaranteed loans. Unlike Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae does not purchase mortgages from lenders, nor does it buy, sell, or issue securities.\nWe conduct business through two business segments, the single-family business segment and the multifamily business segment. Those two segments are primarily supported by our Single-Family Division, Multifamily Division, and Capital Markets Division.\nSingle-Family Business Segment\nOur single-family business segment supports responsible, sustainable homeownership. We do so primarily through the work of our Single- Family Division and Capital Markets Division.Those divisions work with lenders of all sizes – national, regional and community lenders and credit unions – to buy conventional, conforming mortgage loans for one- to four-unit homes – including condominiums and manufactured homes – up to a certain dollar amount set by our regulator. As part of our mission, we are committed to creating homeownership opportunities for people hoping to buy a home for the first time, earning low and moderate incomes and living in underserved markets.\nBecause lenders know they can sell loans to us, they are more willing to make long-term, fixed-rate loans, which make mortgage payments more affordable to more households. When a homeowner faces financial difficulties, we work with the lender to help the borrower avoid foreclosure, where possible, or exit homeownership as smoothly as possible.We also promote liquidity and make funding more available to borrowers by purchasing mortgage-related securities guaranteed by Freddie Mac and other financial institutions as investments. We fund these investments by issuing corporate debt securities. Freddie Mac's investors include, but are not limited to, central and commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies and securities dealers from around the world.\nMultifamily Business Segment\nOur multifamily business segment supports affordable rental opportunities across the nation, primarily through the work of our Multifamily Division and capital markets activities within that group and the Capital Markets Division.\nWorking with a network of specialized lenders, Freddie Mac provides funding for loans on properties ranging from five units to hundreds of units across multiple buildings. We support all types of multifamily properties nationwide, including conventional, seniors, student and subsidized housing as well as smaller properties and manufactured housing communities.\nOur funding is vital to making sure that renters have access to adequate, affordable apartment homes. Around 90 percent of the apartments we finance each year are affordable to low- or moderate-income renters. Multifamily borrowers mainly are commercial entities, such as property developers, and the properties are considered businesses. Our in-house teams closely oversee loan and property quality throughout the life of each loan.\nOn July 18, 2008, Freddie Mac registered its common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Freddie Mac files its period financial disclosure documents with the SEC via the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.\nPrior to Freddie Mac's voluntary registration of its common stock with the SEC on July 18, 2008, Freddie Mac did not file financial reports with the SEC and instead prepared Annual Information Statements and Quarterly Information Statement Supplements in lieu of Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, which are available from the company's Investor Relations Department.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) has been our auditor since March 6, 2002.\nAs announced by FHFA Director, James Lockhart, on September 7, 2008, all future common and preferred stock dividends would be eliminated, other than dividends on the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nFreddie Mac has had two common stock splits. The Board of Directors authorized a 3-for-1 stock split effective April 9, 1992 and a 4-for-1 stock split effective January 13, 1997.\nOur Company\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nMedia Room\nInvestor Relations\nCareers\nOur Suppliers\nOur Business\nSingle-Family Division\nMultifamily Division\nCapital Markets Division\nResources\nMortgage Lookup Tool\nRental Lookup Tool\nMy Home by Freddie Mac®\nCreditSmart®\nConnect With Us\nContact Us\nReport a Security or Privacy Incident\nSign up for news, tips, and insights"

We work with the Federal Housing Finance Agency to ensure all pilots are consistent with our charter and follow established governance processes.\nThe information below is designed to increase transparency around Freddie Mac’s active pilots and test-and-learns, in addition to those that were recently designated inactive.\nIn a housing market marked by high mortgage rates and low housing supply, second mortgages can offer substantial benefits for borrowers, lenders and the overall market — often at a lower risk than some alternatives such as a cash-out refinance. Freddie Mac is engaging in a limited pilot to purchase certain single-family closed-end second mortgages as part of a conditional approval by FHFA, which includes the following terms:\nUpon the pilot’s conclusion, FHFA will analyze the data on Freddie Mac’s purchases of second mortgages to determine whether the objectives of the pilot were met and next steps.\nPilot Scope:Limited rollout started in December 2024.Plan Alignment:N/APilot Status:Active\nTo work with Sellers on improving the quality of performing loans, the company will pilot a replacement to its current repurchase policy for defective performing loans. The pilot will use a fee-based structure that is more efficient, transparent and rewards lenders that deliver high-quality loans. Specifically, lenders will not be subject to repurchases on most performing loans and will instead be subject to a fee-based structure based on non-acceptable quality (NAQ) rates. The fee will apply uniformly to medium and large lenders based on NAQ rates and will be waived for smaller lenders that do not deliver a large enough volume to generate a statistically significant NAQ rate. Loans that are non-performing within 36 months or subject to life of loan defects will still be subject to repurchase. This fee structure will begin with a limited rollout with targeted lenders in early 2024.Pilot Scope:Limited rollout starting in early 2024.Plan Alignment:N/APilot Status:Active\nOur efforts focus on assessing enhancements for new and existing collateral valuation methods. The overarching objectives are to promote more consistent outcomes and maintain appropriate levels of risk management to mitigate the loss associated with default, while creating efficiencies that may save time and lower costs in the appraisal process.Pilot Scope:Limited to target set of lenders, ensuring participation of small and medium size lenders. Pilot is ongoing in 2025.Plan Alignment:N/APilot Status:Active\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused hardships for millions of homeowners, many of who took advantage of forbearance. However, due to long-term or permanent changes in household composition and earnings, we expect some homeowners may require payment relief beyond existing offerings to stay in their homes when their forbearance expires. The Shared Equity Conversion pilot provides eligible distressed borrowers the option to opt-in to shared equity homeownership, in coordination with a loan modification, to receive deeper payment relief and keep their homes.Pilot Scope:The pilot was capped at a fixed number of loans modified. The pilot began in 2022 and has concluded.Plan Alignment:N/APilot Status:Inactive\nAIM for Direct Deposit confirms that a borrower has sufficient income capacity to meet payment obligations, leveraging direct deposits identified from 12-24 months from financial institution account data. This improves risk management. It also reduces the paper documentation burden on borrowers, speeding up loan closings and simplifying the lending process.Pilot Scope:The pilot was capped at a fixed number of loans delivered to Freddie Mac.

The survey is based on first-lien prime conventional conforming home purchase mortgages with a loan-to-value of 80 percent. In addition, the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) products are indexed to U.S. Treasury yields and lenders are asked for both the initial coupon rate and points as well as the margin on the ARM products.\nLenders surveyed each week are a mix of lender types – credit unions, commercial banks and mortgage lending companies – is roughly proportional to the level of mortgage business that each type commands nationwide.\nAs of November 17, 2022, the process for gathering the data was updated. Instead of surveying lenders, the Primary Mortgage Market Survey®results are now based on actual applications from lenders across the country that are submitted to Freddie Mac when a borrower applies for a mortgage.\nAdditionally, we will no longer publish fees/points or adjustable rates.\nThe survey is collected from Thursday through Wednesday and the results are released on Thursdays at 12 p.m. ET.\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

In January 2016, the 1-year ARM was discontinued.\nThe mortgage rate gathering process was updated with the November 17th, 2022 release of the newly enhanced PMMS®.

Therefore, the PMMS®results are now based on the mortgage rate collected from thousands of loan applications submitted to Freddie Mac from lenders across the country when a borrower applies for a mortgage. Additionally, we discontinued adjustable rates and fees/points. Please see theResearch Notefor more detailed information.\nThe newly enhanced PMMS®is published each Thursday at noon ET. When a U.S. holiday falls on a Thursday, the PMMS will publish on the Wednesday of that week.\nThe week of application activity starts at 12:00 a.m. ET the prior Thursday and lasts through 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday. Therefore, the PMMS®results are an average of loan rates offered Thursday through Wednesday.\nCurrently, our lenders are a mix of credit unions, commercial banks, and mortgage lending companies.\nWe collect the mortgage rate of all purchase applications based on PMMS®criteria and a national average mortgage rate is calculated out of all the selected loan applications. The criteria include weekly conventional, single-family originations with conforming loan limits as set by FHFA.\nPMMS®rates are based on applications submitted to Freddie Mac for the given week from lenders across the country.\nARMs indexed to alternatives to U.S. Treasury securities have become more prevalent in the market. As we worked on enhancing the PMMS®, we carefully considered which loan products were most popular for the PMMS®borrower profile (good/excellent credit, 20% loans, home purchase loans on owner occupied 1-unit single-family properties). Additionally, in recent years the mortgage market has been dominated by fixed mortgage products. While there has been an uptick recently in the share of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) for the broader mortgage market, ARMs remain most popular for higher loan size (nonconforming) loans.\nUnder the current LPA requirements, fees and points are not always required to be provided by lenders. Therefore, we are not able to report on the average fees and points.\nThe PMMS®is available on Freddie Mac's web site (www.freddiemac.com) under Mortgage Rates.\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

This increase was primarily driven by higher net interest income from continued mortgage portfolio growth and lower funding costs partially offset by lower yields on short-term investments.\nOur first quarter net interest income was $5.1 billion, up $343 million, or 7 percent year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued mortgage portfolio growth in Single-Family and an increase in the volume of fully guaranteed securitizations in Multifamily.\nNon-interest income for the first quarter was $750 million, a decline of $248 million, or 25 percent lower from the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains in Multifamily.\nNon-interest expense declined $34 million, or 2 percent, year-over-year, primarily due to lower credit enhancement expenses driven by lower volume of cumulative credit risk transfer transactions.\nOur provision for credit losses was $280 million for this quarter, primarily driven by a credit reserve build in Single-Family attributable to new acquisitions.\nSingle-Family Business Segment\nTurning to our individual business segments, the Single-Family segment reported net income of $2.3 billion for the quarter, up $316 million, or 16 percent year-over-year.\nSingle-Family net revenues of $4.9 billion increased 10 percent from the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily driven by a 6 percent increase in our net interest income, which benefited from continued mortgage portfolio growth. Our Single-Family mortgage portfolio at the end of the quarter was $3.1 trillion, up 2 percent year-over-year.\nOur provision for single-family credit losses was an expense of $228 million this quarter, primarily due to a credit reserve build for new acquisitions. The provision in the prior year quarter was $120 million, which was primarily attributable to new acquisitions and increasing mortgage interest rates.\nOur current house price forecast assumes an increase of 4.2 percent over the next 12 months and 2.8 percent over the subsequent 12 months. This is a change from our forecast at the end of last quarter, which assumed 2.7 percent and 3.3 percent growth over the next 12 and subsequent 12 months, respectively.\nThe Single-Family allowance for credit losses coverage ratio at the end of this quarter was 21 basis points, unchanged from last quarter and up 1 basis point year-over-year.\nNew business activity totaled $78 billion this quarter, up from $62 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Both home purchase and refinance activity increased due to higher market coverage and conforming loan limits – as well as house price appreciation in recent quarters. Refinance activity accounted for 21 percent of our total new business activity this quarter, up from 15 percent in the same quarter last year as we saw mortgage rates come down throughout the quarter.\nThe 30-year mortgage rate at the end of the quarter was 6.65 percent, down from 6.85 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and from 6.79 percent at the end of the first quarter 2024. First-time homebuyers represented 52 percent of our total new business activity, or 81,000 households, in the first quarter.\nThe average estimated guarantee fee charged on new business was 54 basis points, while the weighted average original loan-to-value on new purchases was 77 percent, and the weighted average original credit score was 756.\nCredit characteristics of our Single-Family mortgage portfolio remained strong as well, with the weighted average current loan-to-value ratio at 52 percent and the weighted average current credit score at 754.\nAt the end of the quarter, 62 percent of our Single-Family mortgage portfolio had some form of credit enhancement.\nThe Single-Family serious delinquency rate remained low at 59 basis points, unchanged from the prior quarter and up 7 basis points from the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a higher serious delinquency rate for loans originated during and after 2022 as well as lingering impacts from hurricanes that occurred late in 2024. On a related note, in the first quarter, we helped approximately 25,000 families remain in their homes through loan workouts.\nMultifamily Business Segment\nMoving on to Multifamily, the segment reported net income of $533 million dollars, which is down $288 million – or 35 percent – from the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lower non-interest income of $585 million, which decreased $427 million from prior the year quarter. It also was driven by lower revenues from held-for-sale loan purchases and securitization activities, impacts from interest-rate management activities, and less favorable fair value changes from prepayment rates.\nNet interest income of $349 million was up 29 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in the volume of fully guaranteed securitizations.\nThe Multifamily provision for credit losses was an expense of $52 million this quarter versus $61 million in the prior year quarter.\nOur Multifamily new business activity was $10 billion for the first quarter, up $1 billion from a year ago. Our Multifamily business provided financing for 89,000 multifamily rental units in the quarter, with 66 percent of eligible rental units affordable to low-income families.\nAlso in the first quarter, we securitized $16 billion of multifamily loans, $5 billion more than in the prior year quarter. Fully guaranteed securitizations represented 56 percent of total securitizations, up from 36 percent in the first quarter 2024. The average guarantee fee on our total guarantee portfolio increased 5 basis points year-over-year to 52 basis points.\nOur Multifamily mortgage portfolio increased 5 percent year-over-year to $467 billion.\nThe Multifamily delinquency rate at end of the quarter was 46 basis points. This was up 12 basis points from 34 basis points at the end of March 2024 and up 6 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase in the delinquency rate was primarily driven by increased delinquencies in our floating rate loans, including small balance loans that are in their floating rate period. Ninety-eight percent of these delinquent loans had credit enhancement coverage at the end of the quarter. At the Multifamily mortgage portfolio level, our credit enhancement coverage was 93 percent.\nCapital\nOn the capital front, our net worth increased to $62.4 billion dollars at the end of the quarter, representing a 24 percent increase year-over-year.\nLet me conclude by noting that many of you are closely following the announcements and orders issued by Director Pulte and what those mean for Freddie Mac.\nBriefly, Director Pulte has helped us streamline our business and harness the productivity of thousands of Freddie Mac employees now in the office full-time.\nHe has eliminated activities not central to Freddie Mac’s mission, as well as requirements that may make it more expensive to finance a loan, but which might provide little tangible benefit to the majority of American renters and homebuyers. We support actions he has taken to drive fraud and waste out of the U.S. housing finance system.\nWe expect the savings associated with FHFA’s new direction to reduce Freddie Mac’s general and administrative expenses in 2025 and beyond. Furthermore, we believe that regulatory changes making it easier for us to responsibly acquire loans will increase our revenue and enable us to provide even greater liquidity to the single-familyandmultifamily market.\nThat should enable Freddie Mac to invest more in critical technology, increase our net worth, and lower the cost of originating a mortgage.\nTaking a step back, the Director has challenged us to create a more affordable U.S. housing system. We are committed to rising to that challenge.\n©2025 by Freddie Mac.\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nJim Whitlinger is executive vice president and chief financial officer.
